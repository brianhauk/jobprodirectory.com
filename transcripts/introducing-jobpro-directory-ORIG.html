                                <p>Hi. My name is Brian Hauk and I'm here to introduce you to JobPro Directory and this series of short tutorial videos demonstrating how JobPro can help you take charge of your job search and find better employment faster by breaking down one of the major barriers to you finding the right job with the right employer.</p>
                                
                                <p>While a major and common barrier to your job search success can be not having a clear job search goal (because how can you achieve a career goal you don't have?), that's not the one I'm going to focus on overcoming here, because you likely have a good idea of what you want in your next job and "get" that there's a better, more effective approach to finding work. That's why you're here - to more effectively find employers best matching your career building needs, and establish communication with them to get the jobs you want and need to achieve your career goals. Right?</p> 
                                
                                <p>Throughout these JobPro Directory tutorials I will show you how to overcome the other major barrier preventing many job seekers from finding jobs they want and need. That barrier is the absense of a planned, methodical approach to finding the right employers combined with inadequate employer research tools. Our focus throughout these job search tutorials will be on creating and following a planned approach to achieving your career goals by following a job search 'Action Plan' tailored to your needs and those of the employers you're targeting.</p>
                                                                                                
                                 <p>This introduction is a brief overview of how JobPro can help you save time doing better employer research to learn the needs of employers and their decision makers, so you can more easily identity the best employers for you, make great first impressions, get interviews and the jobs you want.</p>
                                
                                <p>The following tutorials focus on finding these employers and connecting with their decision makers and others able to influence your hiring. To increase your job search effectiveness, we will divide your entire job search into smaller, more easily managed tasks, each having clear goals so you can measure your progress and remain effective across all phases of your job search 'campaign' targeting employers.</p>

                                    <p>These tasks and goals include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                          <li><b>Researching Employers</b> to discover companies and non-profit organizations you want to work for based on your interests, experience, abilities and financial needs.</li>
                                          <p>- Your goal in doing this is to build a list of potential employers to "target" in the 'Targeting Employers and Decision Makers' phase of your job search. Include all interesting potential employers in this early stage of building your list. You can later add and remove employers based on your employer and employer contact research results.</p>
                                          
                                          <li><b>Mapping Employer Locations</b> to know the distance and time from your home to each employer you consider targeting</li>
                                          <p>- Your goal in doing this is to avoid shortlisting/targeting employers outside of an acceptable commuting distance and time, unless you <u>really</u> want to work with them and are prepared to commute long distances or move to their distant location.</p>
                                          
                                          <li><b>Researching Decision Makers</b> for each targeted employer to learn the names and needs of people who can hire you, or who can help you get hired. Add them to your list of targeted employer contacts and learn what's likely to resonate with them and motivate them to notice you. Keep only the best 1 or 2 contacts for each employer.</li>                                          
                                          <p>- Your goal in doing this is to find the right people and learn what it takes to get them to notice you.</p>
                                          
                                          <li><b>Targeting Employers and Decision Makers</b> with effective cover letters, resumes, employment proposals and cold-calling. You can approach them with confidence knowing what's likely to resonate with them and motivate them to interview and hire you. Do this using knowledge gained through your employer research to clearly explain or demonstrate that you can efficiently solve many of their problems and become better at doing what they do. This usually means demonstrating how you can make them money, save them time and help them stand out as a provider of superior products or services within their market space or industry vertical.</li>
                                          <p>- Your goal in doing this is to get noticed in a positive way, and get interviewed or informally meet with them even if they are not hiring.</p>
                                    </ul>
                                
                                <p><b><u>Not discussed</u></b> is the importance of measuring your success and changing something if you're not achieving these goals. For example, if you are not getting interviews in the <b>Targeting Employers and Decision Makers</b> phase of your job search, you may need to improve your cover letter, resume or employment proposal, follow-up "cold calling" script, or select better employer contacts.</p>
                                
                                <p>Some ideas for these improvements are available at <a href="http://www.jobprodirectory.com/job-search.html" target="new">www.jobprodirectory.com/job-search.html</a>.
