						better employment and minimize time spent &quot;between

						faster if you act on the knowledge of what it takes to
						lead a successful job search campaign. The following job
						search tips are designed to be accurate and sufficiently
						complete to enable you to find better work faster, and
						so that you won&#39;t have to read anything more before
						starting your new job.<br>
						<br>
						Job search results prove that people who draw on the
						lessons of other successful job seekers experience a
						heightened ability to efficiently find better employment
						in less time than would be required using conventional
						job search ideologies and methods. <br>
						<br>
						These results prove that job seekers able to stand head and shoulders
						above the competition by applying the following effective job search
						strategies that are relatively unknown to the majority
						of job hunters will benefit to the tune of thousands of
						additional dollars in their bank accounts as they find
						work faster while avoiding possible loss of self-esteem
						and unemployment-related depression and anxiety. <br>

						necessary to change objectives to find work and
						recognize that your job finding problems are rooted in a
						tough job market in order to avoid feeling that you must

						you for interviews.

						<strong>Understanding What Works and What Does Not</strong><br>
						<br>
						The collective experience of job seekers proves that
						posting your r&eacute;sum&eacute; at hundreds of job sites or
						&quot;blasting&quot; it to hundreds of recruiters and employers is
						a self-defeating strategy. This approach won&#39;t let you
						customize it for a specific employer or job opportunity,
						and so you likely will not be called. You
                        also won&#39;t be able to follow up by calling or e-mailing
                        the large number of employers who receive your r&eacute;sum&eacute;
						and will miss opportunities to establish contact and move
                        your application forward in the hiring process. <br>
                        <br>
                        In fact, sending a r&eacute;sum&eacute; in response to an ad is one of the
						least effective methods of finding a job, according to
						J. Michael Farr, author of &quot;Getting the Job You Really
						Want&quot; (JIST Works Inc., 2002). This is because hundreds
						of other candidates are responding to ads, causing a
						deluge of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s in human resource departments. <br>
						<br>
						As part of your proactive job search campaign, you will
						find it more effective to (when
						possible) send r&eacute;sum&eacute;s <u>only to named individuals having the
						power to hire you</u>. Try to avoid office managers, the Human
						Resources department where it exists, and other
						&quot;gatekeepers&quot; whose duty is to keep you from
						communicating with people having the authority to hire
						you.<br>
						<br>
						As an alternative to mass mailing form letters, you can take important steps toward meeting
                        employer  contacts by sending individual, targeted messages to these named individuals as part
                        of building your network.&nbsp;
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"><br>
						<br>
						The key word here is &#39;contacts,&#39;</span> because, as part of implementing the proactive job<img border="0" src="images/jobsearch_international_students.jpg" title="Developing and effectively using your network of contacts can help you find better employment faster." width="300" height="200" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"> search campaign targeting employers advocated here, you will be creating a network of employer contacts who know you as someone intelligent, trustworthy, interesting and easy to work with, in addition to being skilled and experienced [if you are]. Once you&#39;re clear on the steps taken by employers to recruit new hires [explained later], the value of being in this position will become even more evident.<br>
						<br>
						To develop and strengthen your network of contacts, you
						will need to research employers to learn about their
						needs and also to find the names and contact information
						for people working for them who have the power to hire
						you. These are the people you need to include in your
						network, and to meet, so that they can get to know you.
						<br>
						<br>
						The feedback you receive while researching and getting
						to know employers and employer contacts can provide you with
						the motivation you need to take action to advance your
						job search. Having quick access to company and contact
						information as you go about this task will enable you to
						maintain your job search momentum and avoid getting
						bogged down in the time-consuming task of manually
						searching for the information you need to effectively target
						employers. <br>
						<br>
						Your employer research will help you identify their needs, and
						your main challenge knowing their needs will be to
						find a way to communicate your ability to meet them using your cover letter and r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and by talking
						to them on the phone and in person.

<h2 align="left">Mining the Hidden Job Market To Create Your New Career</h2>
<br />
<strong>Running a Proactive Job Search Campaign Targeting Employers</strong>
		<p align="left" class="addspace">Job searching and networking are really about
		getting yourself noticed. You must do this in an organized and formal
		process so that you maintain control. You will be creating lists of
		companies to approach, lists of people currently working at your target
		companies, maintaining records of interviews, records of conversations
		and their results, and next steps you must perform per company. <br>
		<br>
		Networking is the process of making acquaintances and getting to know many
		other people. You need to let them find out who you are, what you have to offer, and
		what kind of job you are looking for. Networking is considered the most
		effective way of finding a job, and it demands time and motivation. The more people know you, the
		better your chances of finding the right job.&nbsp;
		<br>
		<br>
		When first conceived, new jobs are like precious gems: They&#39;re hidden
		until you find them. It makes sense, then, to be a job &#39;miner&#39; instead
		of a job seeker. Job miners combine their skills, experience and
		connections to strike at the entire lode of possibilities. Miners are
		active, not passive, and they focus on the future, not the past, to
		create opportunities. <br>
		<br>
		Lily Jiang, an internationally trained professional with an engineering background, used the mining approach after being terminated from her position as a market research director for a Vancouver area	biotechnology company. Following the firing,
		Ms. Jiang moved back to a job she previously held with a BC government agency while she looked for more challenging work. She began networking, and, based on the information she gathered, developed a job proposal that led to a new position as Director of Engineering Services being created for her at another government agency.
<br>


		<br>
		For Ms. Jiang, mining for connections and support taught her how to
		learn from every experience during her search, no matter how difficult,
		and to apply that knowledge to her quest of finding a new position. <br>
		<br>
		In contrast, a former senior marketing manager for a telecommunications
		company in Richmond, BC, remains a job seeker. He&#39;s been looking for
		a new position since last year, when he was reassigned to a project
		that&#39;s clearly not going to advance his career, and which will soon end
		and result in him being laid off. His method of looking for work has been
		passive: reading company bulletins and trade journals for
		advertisements. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;Perhaps something will come up before this position ends. For now, I&#39;m applying for everything I see advertised that&#39;s
		remotely appropriate&quot;, he says.
		<br>

<br><br>
<a href="#anchorPagetop" onclick="smoothScroll();return false;"><img height="19" border="0" width="20" title="Go to top" src="images/top_of_page.gif"/>&nbsp;Top of page</a>
<br><br>

		<strong><br>
		Untapped and Unpublished<br>
		</strong><br>
		Job mining makes sense for many reasons. Consider that only about 20% to
		30% of all available positions are advertised, but since most people
		focus 80% to 90% of their search effort on these jobs, the competition
		for them is greatest. That means the smallest probable returns for your
		effort. <br>
		<br>
		In contrast, about two-thirds of all jobs are on managers&#39; wish lists,
		still unofficial or being circulated on networks in the form of, &quot;I&#39;d
		like to find someone who could...&quot; These comprise the hidden job market.
		Once advertised, the window of opportunity closes on getting hired
		quickly. Besides more competition, there are structured hiring protocols
		(job descriptions, hiring committees, r&eacute;sum&eacute; screening) and established
		compensation ranges to contend with. <br>
		<br>
		The mining process is focused less on past titles and more on
		accomplishments, flexibility and transferable experience. You may need
		to prove your ability to react quickly, apply your experience in new
		ways or get things done without title-power. Here&#39;s where miners find
		chances to strike it rich. <br>
		<br>
		Barbara Dawid, Marketing &amp; Resource Advisor, Job Placement &amp; Resource
		Centre@Training Institute, Immigrant Services Society of BC says: &quot;Job miners take action to translate their areas of strength
		into new situations, tune in to opportunities beyond those described by
		someone else and change their focus from what &#39;is&#39; to what &#39;could be&#39; &quot;.
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong><br>
		Become a Miner<br>
&nbsp;</strong><br>
		Job mining involves shifting at least half of your search energy and
		strategies into finding ways to become the solution to an organizational
		challenge. It may mean using short-term or &quot;disposable&quot; employment to
		gain experience and exposure. This might include taking on project work,
		portfolio jobs or volunteering in a community setting or professional
		association to make new contacts or broaden your skills. Here are the
		steps to take to become a miner:
		<br>
		<br>
		1. <strong>Determine what interests you</strong><br>
		<br>
		What is it that you want to do? Marketing professionals begin by
		defining the product and the audience. Who will be interested in you?
		Whom do you want to interest? What do you offer them? <br>
		<br>
		Do some self-assessment. What engages and challenges you? Internet
		resources, published career guides and career coaches can help you
		develop this self-awareness quickly if need help.
        <br>
		<br>
	    Be clear on how your skills and experience translates into results.
        Don&#39;t expect employers to make the leap. Be	ready to say how your skills
        can be applied to different functions or industries. Also know how to discuss
        your failures. Self-knowledge means	being able to say what you learned from difficult
        situations.
        <br>
		<br>

<br><br>
<a href="#anchorPagetop" onclick="smoothScroll();return false;"><img height="19" border="0" width="20" title="Go to top" src="images/top_of_page.gif"/>&nbsp;Top of page</a>
<br><br>

		<br>
		2.  <strong>Market yourself</strong><br>
		<br>
		You must shake the tree for opportunities. This means focusing on the
		future, researching new growth areas and making connections. Whenever
		possible, choose people over paper. Try to meet with contacts instead of
		mailing r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, says Rosemary Barnhart, a career consultant in Olympia,
		Wash. <br>
		<br>
		A monthly networking group she started that meets at 6:45 a.m. for
		breakfast now includes more than 75 attendees from various businesses
		and industries. They focus on forming business collaborations and
		learning about new opportunities. They mine all year long. <br>
		<br>
		Create opportunities to talk to new people, especially those in
		different segments of your industry, other industries, positions of
		leadership or other roles that allow them to know about future growth
		plans. Most miners find jobs through a wider circle of contacts than the
		four or five people they know well. To meet more people, attend
		conferences, volunteer for committee work or make presentations. <br>
		<br>
		Job titles can be limiting. To create new possibilities, discard labels
		you&#39;ve worn. Have personal business cards printed without your title.
		Use them to introduce yourself. Create a personal commercial  -  a brief,
		positive self-introduction to describe yourself in a way that helps
		others feel they&#39;ve connected with you. <br>
		<br>
		Examine your self-marketing documents such as biographies, r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and
		portfolios. These are your personal representatives. Does the
		information in your r&eacute;sum&eacute; reflect what you want to do in the future? Is
		it presented in a way that will hook a prospective employer? Do your
		cover letters address solutions employers are buying? Consider sending
		personal letters to hiring managers instead of typical cover letters and
		r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. Determine if your personal appearance and presentation skills
		are adequate. If not, seek help in both areas from career professionals.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		3. <strong>Remove obstacles<br>
		</strong><br>
		Mining involves seeing the possibilities that lie below the surface and
		being ready to seize them. If hiring is slow in your industry or
		geographic area, do research to determine areas of greatest opportunity
		and explore them. <br>
		<br>
		This may mean making difficult decisions in advance about relocating.
		Few things can be more damaging to a family or personal relationship
		than having to decide whether to stay or move after an opportunity
		becomes available. The process is doubly difficult if you are part of a
		dual-career couple. <br>
		<br>
		Decide on your job-search criteria before you start mining. What are the
		relative weights of each? How long will you look locally before
		branching out? Write down your specifications. Invent a point system for
		evaluating opportunities and rating your progress.
		<br>

<br><br>
		<br>
		4. <strong>Stay energized and positive</strong><br>
		<br>
		If you have let things slide, now is the time to accelerate your
		efforts. Build mental muscle by talking about your desires and goals.
		Just as your body&#39;s muscles become stronger with repetition, your mental
		picture of your desired outcome will become more real every time you
		repeat it. <br>
		<br>
		To stay positive, use the rubber-band trick. Wear a rubber band around
		your wrist and snap it when you think a negative thought. Ask a friend
		to hold you accountable for thinking positively. Talking positively
		about your mining activity will help you stay focused on the future. <br>
		<br>
		If you&#39;re unemployed, resist the temptation to isolate yourself. Don&#39;t
		spend your days sending e-mails and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. This can make you feel
		productive, but the lack of response from employers can lead to
		self-criticism and depression. <br>
		<br>
		Change your schedule so your days are
		spent calling contacts, arranging meetings and attending events that
		allow you to meet more people. Save evenings for Internet follow-up
		activities. Set goals and track your accomplishments. Keep a success
		calendar and post your big and small achievements in it each day.		</p>

<br><br>

		<br>
		<strong>What&#39;s the Alternative?</strong><br>
		<br>
		Networking is usually defined as seeking referrals through others. The
		emphasis is on securing an introduction to a hiring manager before you
		make the call. Almost everyone who has ever studied job hunting will
		tell you that it&#39;s the surest method of finding a job, yet you&#39;ve
		networked your network to the bone and the results are skimpy or
		non-existent. Don&#39;t fret. Research shows that there&#39;s another method of
		landing interviews that&#39;s even better than networking.<br>
		<br>
		It&#39;s called <strong>cold calling</strong> or <strong>direct contact</strong>, and it means just that: making cold calls to people who might be able to hire you, and telling them about your
		availability and interest in working for them. Research shows that it&#39;s
		surprisingly effective.<br>
		<br>
		A recent survey of professionals, managers and executives by the Five O&#39;Clock Network, a career-counseling network based in New York City, shows
		that direct contact is a more effective use of your time when seeking
		meetings with hiring managers. <br>
		<br>
		Their results showed that job seekers who called association members, professionals
		identified through newspaper articles or Internet research, and other
		contacts in a position to hire were more effective in their job search.
		<br>
		<br>
		They also found that job hunters spent 24% of their time making these kinds of cold
		calls, which yielded 27% of their meetings. In contrast, they spent 45%
		of their time networking, yet this job-search technique produced only
		35% of their meetings, the Five O&#39;Clock Network reports.<br>
		<br>
		While these results may not seem too startling, they reveal that <strong>cold
		calling/direct contact is the most time-efficient method for getting meetings because
		you can take action yourself</strong>. Networking takes more time and is
		more cumbersome than using direct contact, because if you&#39;re networking,
		you have to use a third party. Then you may have to get yet another
		name before you reach the hiring authority.<br>
		<br>
		The survey also showed that direct contact was effective for even job hunters looking for work as senior executives. Although they secured most of their
		meetings through networking, direct contact accounted for almost 30%.

<br><br>
<a href="#anchorPagetop" onclick="smoothScroll();return false;"><img height="19" border="0" width="20" title="Go to top" src="images/top_of_page.gif"/>&nbsp;Top of page</a>
<br><br>
		Because of the high level of success many job seekers have in cold
		calling, career counselors often recommend that you spend at least 80% of
		your time on the phone contacting hiring managers directly. In making
		your cold calls as a job seeker targeting employers, keep in mind that
		two-thirds of all job openings are with small businesses having fewer
		than twenty-five employees.
		<br>
		<br>
		It&#39;s also <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">super important that you
		understand that most of your "cold calls" can be
		made warmer and more effective if you take the time to research
		employers to determine their needs and how you may be able to help them before calling them</span>.
		<u>Doing this employer research prior to contacting them can not only
		make employers more receptive to your calls, but will also enable you to
		create better customized r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and attention-getting cover letters
		which give you a stronger competitive edge, and through them, more
		interviews and job offers</u>.<br>
		<br>
		<strong><br>
		Why Direct Contact Works<br>
		</strong><br>
		Why is direct contact so effective? The approach emphasizes looking for
		new positions in the marketplace before they&#39;re known to the general
		public via newspapers and other advertising.<br>
		<br>
		Using direct contact circumvents the many time-consuming steps required
		by traditional methods of job searching. You don&#39;t have to find someone
		who can refer you to a hiring manager. <br>
		<br>
		If you&#39;re applying to a large corporation, you must get through a series
		of screening techniques...filling out an application, getting your
		r&eacute;sum&eacute; entered into a database, getting through the human-resources
		department, and passing a phone interview before you even see the face
		of a decision maker. Picking up the phone and talking to somebody almost
		always works better.<br>
		<br>
		Everyone makes the mistake of placing too much
		importance on published openings. The alternative? Contact organizations
		that don&#39;t publicize openings now, and stay in touch with them. This
		increases the chance they&#39;ll hire you, rather than post the job, when
		they need help.
        <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Four Simple Steps</strong><br>
		<br>
		Most job seekers can use this technique if they apply some time-tested
		tactics. It involves just a few simple steps.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		1. <strong>Adjust your attitude</strong><br>
		<br>
		Adopt the posture of a busy CEO running your own business. When you
		approach executives and hiring managers at businesses you&#39;d like to work
		for, think of yourself as an equal. Act as if you&#39;re a busy professional
		making a business proposal, rather than a job hunter seeking a position.
		Think of your r&eacute;sum&eacute; as a powerful business proposal outlining a
		contribution you&#39;d like to make to that company, not as a document
		describing past accomplishments.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		2. <strong>Do your homework on employers<br>
		</strong><br>
		Select the companies you&#39;d like to work for regardless of whether
		they advertise an opening. You can choose companies you know
		about, peruse the Yellow Pages for businesses in your area, and use Internet databases.
		Choose search criteria including industry, location and company size to
		limit search results to a manageable number so you can target these
		employers in a quality way. Find a job search resource offering useful
		company information including a company synopsis, location, names of
		decision makers and other related material. <br>
		<br>
		Your local library will also have some helpful business databases. If you&#39;re
		unemployed, you will most likely qualify to use a local government-sponsored job search resource center like YWCA Employment Programs &amp; Centres, or a host of other Service Canada-funded
		organizations paid to assist you in your job search.<br>
		<br>
		Unfortunately, many people make employment decisions solely on the information they glean from job interviews and perhaps
		what they read on a prospective employer&#39;s web site. In short, they&#39;re making long-term career decisions using only information over which the employers have a great deal of control.
        <br>
		<br>
		Such blind faith can be	especially dangerous for technology workers, who often find themselves choosing between a company that has a clear information-technology vision and one that&#39;s about to be left in the technological dust. The result: Within months or weeks you may find yourself in a difficult work environment after letting a better opportunity slip away.<br>
		<br>
		You should also care about the company&#39;s work culture and how satisfied its employees are to work there. You can do this using both the internet and in person as part of your employer research.
        <br>
		<br>
		Once you&#39;re done researching an employer, it&#39;s time to visit them. If you&#39;re arriving for an interview, get there early. Try hanging out in the parking lot to pick up clues about a company. Act like a sponge collecting information. Notice how employees dress  -  you&#39;ll get a sense of how formal or informal the work environment is to help you gauge how you might fit in. <br>
		<br>
		At the same time, seeing how people interact  -  do they greet each other or walk to the
		door with their heads hanging  -  reveals a lot about how enjoyable the
		place is. If possible, go both early and late in the day to try to
		determine the time commitments the company places on its employees. Try
		informally chatting with anyone from landscapers  to receptionists to gauge
		their degree of satisfaction and long-term interest in the company.<br>
		<br>
		Try to catch someone standing in the lobby or walking out the door to
		see if they&#39;d accept a phone call after business hours. People don&#39;t
		know you and many may not cooperate. But others will, and from them
		you&#39;ll learn a lot about whether this is a great place to work or
		whether the managers are tyrants who will keep you there every night
		until 10.

<br><br>
		<br>
		3. <strong>Research the decision makers</strong><br>
		<br>
		Once you&#39;ve targeted the companies you&#39;d like to work for, identify the
		person with the power to hire you. Most likely, this is the boss of the
		person who would be your manager if you worked at that company.
		Introduce yourself, by phone, with a &quot;pitch&quot; that includes your name,
		level of experience and a key accomplishment. If he or she is receptive,
		give them a bit of background information on, say, your experience or
		education, and
		request an interview.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		4. <strong>Follow up</strong><br>
		<br>
		Offer answers to the contact&#39;s objections. If he or she says, &quot;We don&#39;t
		have any openings right now,&quot; your response should be: &quot;That&#39;s fine.
		What I&#39;m really interested in is finding a company that&#39;s a good match
		for my skills for the long term. I&#39;d like to meet with you to discuss
		potential future opportunities. When would this be convenient?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		After you&#39;ve agreed on an appointment time, send a thank-you note citing
		your appreciation for the manager&#39;s time on the phone and confirming the
		meeting.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Picking Up the Phone</strong><br>
		<br>
		It&#39;s true that most people don&#39;t want to pick up the phone and &quot;pitch&quot;
		their skills to a complete stranger. But many job seekers have had
		success with this approach.<br>
		<br>
		Michael Guevara, an unemployed director of engineering in North Vancouver, BC, was laid off last summer. Initially, he balked at the idea of cold calling. &quot;I&#39;m not a salesman,&quot; he protested. &quot;I&#39;m an engineer!&quot; But
		since he&#39;d been jobless for seven months and was running out of funds,
		he decided to give it a try.<br>
		<br>
		Mr. Guevara didn&#39;t hit pay dirt on his first, second even tenth call. It
		took 15 tries before he finally set up an appointment. He secured a
		meeting with an engineering executive at a large media conglomerate. The
		interview was a success. Six weeks ago, he was promised a senior
		engineering manager position in the next three months, when the job is
		vacated due to retirement. He&#39;s continuing to search in the interim as
		he knows the hiring climate at employers can shift at any time.<br>
		<br>
		As a sales and marketing executive in Richmond, BC, Toni Goldberg was an old
		hand at cold calling. After being laid off from International Business
		Machines Corp. in 2009, she made this method her chief job-search tool.
		Ms. Goldberg was either lucky, or all those years of cold calling as a
		young sales manager paid off. She made appointments for four
		face-to-face meetings in less than an hour. She had her pick of new
		positions. Within three weeks, she had accepted an offer that came with
		an 18% pay increase.<br>
		<br>
		Given the scarcity of openings in this tight job market, relying on
		published advertisements isn&#39;t the best way to learn about available
		positions. And when networking isn&#39;t working, direct contact is an
		effective route to a new job.<br>
		<br>
		It doesn&#39;t take a special personality to use this strategy. Even shy
		people can make it work. Be prepared to persist. The majority of your
		calls won&#39;t result in a meeting. When one finally does, you&#39;ll be
		booking an interview before your competition gets a chance to press send them their resume.

	<strong>Write a Persuasive Cover Letter</strong> </div>
              </li>
              <ul class="centertextlevel2" id="WritingAPersuasiveCoverLetter">

		<p class="addspace">For many people, cover letters are an annoyance they&#39;d be quite happy to
		avoid. People frequently ask themselves &quot;Do I have to send a cover letter with
		my r&eacute;sum&eacute;?&quot;  -  nearly always in the hope they&#39;ll hear that in their
		particular case a cover letter is unnecessary ... that they&#39;ll do just
		as well sending only their r&eacute;sum&eacute; to prospective employers. <br><br>
		Perhaps the reason this question is so common is because so many cover
		letters are indeed a waste of paper. It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to wonder
		if you have to include a letter when you&#39;re going to say little more
		than &quot;here&#39;s my r&eacute;sum&eacute;; hope to hear from you soon.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Even the term &quot;cover letter&quot; suggests a mere formality  -  just a cover
		for the real material you&#39;re sending. <br>
		<br>
		But you can do much better than that. <u>A cover letter is an opportunity</u>
		to tap into an individual employer&#39;s aspirations and anxieties. Your
		r&eacute;sum&eacute; is about you, but employers don&#39;t really care about you. They
		care about what you can do for them  -  the problems you can help them
		solve and the opportunities you can help them take advantage of. <br>
		<br>
		Your cover letter is your opportunity to go beyond the r&eacute;sum&eacute; and its
		focus on your past and future to talk about what the reader
		cares most about  -  themselves. It is a sales letter, and all good sales
		letters are written with the reader&#39;s interests foremost in mind. <br>
		<br>
		If you&#39;re mailing your r&eacute;sum&eacute; to an employer, you should always include
		a cover letter. Always. <br>
		<br />
		<strong>Customize your Cover Letter</strong><br>
		You should <u>customize this letter to meet the needs of the
		particular employer you&#39;re contacting</u>. This means you will usually avoid
		generic cover letters  -  letters that you could send to any employer you
		have an interest in. Instead, you&#39;ll make the effort to write a letter
		that addresses the specific concerns of each individual employer. <br />
		<br />
		<strong>Use a Cover Letter Template</strong><br />
		Some parts of your letter should usually be common to each customized cover letter,
		particularly when you&#39;re approaching very similar businesses, but you
		will want to customize it whenever doing this is to your advantage / will give you a competive edge.<br>
		<br>
		Customizing requires thinking about the company, their customers, and
		the work you see yourself doing. It means imagining yourself in the
		position and the situations you&#39;d be facing, and figuring out the
		abilities and traits you possess that are important for success. <br>
		<br>
		For any position, there are two types of skills: core skills that any
		serious applicant will be expected to have, and a much broader range of
		skills that would be useful to the employer but go beyond the basic
		requirements. You have to spend some time thinking about both types.
		Having the first kind gets you in the game; the second will make you
		stand out from the competition. <br>
		<br>
		Your letter should be as close to a business proposal as you can get  -
		not a plea for an interview. What do you offer that&#39;s of value? What
		objectives can you help them achieve? Try to <u>focus on their needs</u>  -
		what they want to buy rather than what you&#39;d like to sell.

		<br><br />

		<strong>Writing your cover letter</strong><br>
		Someone is going to read your letter. It will land on their desk or in their email Inbox, and
		they will take time away from the work they were doing to
		read it. <br>
		<br>
		What action do you want the reader to take at this point? What is it you
		want them to do with your letter? Why are you writing? Your letter needs to tell them this.<br>
		<br>
		One way or the other, the next step you want to get to is usually a
		telephone conversation of some kind  -  preferably initiated by the
		employer, but far more likely initiated by you. What you want the reader
		to do at this point is either to call you, or to accept your call. From
		there, you&#39;ll usually try to move on to a face-to-face meeting. <br>
		<br>
		You&#39;re going to try to get to that next step by answering the
		fundamental worksearch question: What value do you have to offer? How
		will the employer be better off with you than they are now? Your r&eacute;sum&eacute;
		should provide the evidence to make your claims credible. <br>
		<br>
		Appeal to their self-interest. Whenever possible, take advantage of
		their hopes and worries  - and greed. The hiring process is as much
		emotional as logical. In all effective sales letters, the reader comes
		first. This is a lot easier to say than do. You have to imagine them,
		empathize with them and do your best to give them the motivation to do
		what you want them to do. <br>
		<br>
		Keep paragraphs short. No more than seven lines, and preferably five or
		fewer. Vary the sentence length. None of the sentences should be very
		long, but you don&#39;t want a staccato stream of very short sentences. Try
		using the occasional sentence fragment. Like this. Or begin with
		conjunctions  -  and, but, or. <br>
		<br>
		Use a one-sentence paragraph to emphasize a statement. <br>
		<br>
		And you can use boldface type and italics to draw attention to specific
		parts of your letter. You have to be careful with underlining because
		the line is often printed too close to the word, reducing its
		readability. <br>
		<br>
		These devices should be used sparingly to make the highlights stand out
		when the reader gives your letter a quick skim (which may be all it ever
		gets if they don&#39;t see anything to make them want to read on). <br>
		<br>
		Write in a friendly, conversational tone, and avoid stiff businessese
		like &quot;enclosed please find my r&eacute;sum&eacute; for your perusal&quot; or &quot;I am sending
		my r&eacute;sum&eacute; in regards to the above mentioned position.&quot; Forget all about
		what you think a business letter &quot;should&quot; sound like. Don&#39;t use a
		thesaurus to replace good simple words with ornate and awkward language.
		<br>
		<br>
		Be a real person, not an automaton churning it out by rote. Show some
		personality and enthusiasm. <br>
		<br>
		Avoid vague statements  -  specifics sell. A letter that could be sent to
		any employer merely by replacing the name of the company  -  called a
		&quot;broadcast&quot; letter  -  can probably be improved with more specifics. If
		you&#39;re planning on a mass mailing, the broadcast format may be your best
		choice, but you should be aware that there are trade-offs between high
		volume and customization. It&#39;s much harder to create reader involvement
		with a letter that could have been sent to anyone (and probably has).
		<br>
		<br>
		Think twice before using any adjectives or adverbs. A common mistake is
		what I call the Roget Style of writing where a truck load of adjectives
		is dumped all over the letter. The writer of one letter I&#39;ve got in
		front of me claims to be &quot;competent,&quot; &quot;reliable,&quot; &quot;committed,&quot; and
		&quot;outstanding&quot;  -  all in one paragraph! Another says she&#39;s &quot;motivated and
		dedicated.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Says you! Unsubstantiated puffery adds nothing. The reader isn&#39;t going
		to think of you as one scintilla more competent just because you
		describe yourself that way. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;Effectively&quot; and &quot;efficiently&quot; are particularly weak  -  and some people
		sprinkle them in their letters like confetti. What was so efficient or
		effective about what you did? How do you know? If you can answer those
		questions, then put that down instead. And if you can&#39;t answer them,
		you&#39;re probably better off saying nothing. <br>
		<br>
		If you start describing yourself as &quot;well organized, proactive, and
		dedicated; a team player with excellent oral and written communication
		skills&quot; or any other clich&eacute;s, you&#39;ll be laughed at more than admired.
		<br>
		<br>
		What can you do for this organization? Try converting &quot;I haves&quot; into
		&quot;you wants&quot;  -  or &quot;you don&#39;t wants&quot; if you can play on a fear the
		employer may have and show how hiring you would eliminate it.

<br>
		<strong>Open quickly ... with a difference</strong><br>
		Every cover letter guide talks about the importance of an opening that
		&quot;grabs attention&quot; or &quot;generates interest.&quot; Then they turn around and
		give sample letters with standard openers like: <br>
		<br>
		&quot;Please accept this letter as application for the Process Engineer
		position currently available with your company.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		&quot;I am very interested in obtaining a position with your organization.
		Enclosed please find my r&eacute;sum&eacute; for your review.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		&quot;In response to your ad in the [paper] I wish to apply for the position
		of [whatever].&quot;
        <br />
		<br>
		Give these lines full marks for getting to the point, but they could
		have been written by a machine. Instead of generating interest, these
		openers have the employer thinking &quot;here&#39;s another one!&quot; They&#39;ve read
		the same line dozens of times before. <br />
		<br>
		For advertised openings, probably 90 percent of the responses begin by
		mentioning the ad. Which means this is something you might want to
		avoid. <br>
		<br>
		Brian Hauk, a career coach in Vancouver, BC developed
		this opening which, while not particularly gripping, lets you get to the
		point quickly and sound like a human being: <br>
		<br>
		Several things you mention in your ad for a [position advertised] make
		me think you may be looking for someone with my experience. Let me
		briefly explain.<br>
		<br>
		There are many ways to open your letter. Whatever opening you use, get
		to the point quickly  -  or the reader will move on to something else.
		Here are some ways to begin: <br>
		<br>
		Personal Referral: &quot;John Hughes from [wherever] suggested I contact you
		about ...&quot; If you have a name to drop, the beginning of your letter is
		usually the best place to do it. A good way to get your letter past
		anyone screening the mail of the person you&#39;re writing to. <br>
		<br>
		Question or Headline: I&#39;m not a fan of this approach. As much as  techniques from direct mail selling may be effective, this approach may scream
		&quot;advertising!&quot; (or, even worse, &quot;junk mail!&quot;) and hinder the
		personal connection you&#39;re trying to make. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>News You&#39;ve Read: Usually about the company or their industry:</strong>
        This can be done very well or very poorly  -  it comes down to how strongly you
		connect this tidbit to something that will make the reader interested in
		you. No one really cares about what you&#39;ve read, but if you quickly
		segue into discussing how this news made you think you can contribute to
		the organization, then you&#39;ve got a strong opening. <br>
		<br>
		Quotation/Saying: Certainly different, but it should be directly related
		to a good reason for the employer to meet with you (see sample letter
		#2). <br>
		<br>
		Your Job Objective: You haven&#39;t done anything yet to make the reader
		care what you&#39;re looking for. It&#39;s better to talk about what the reader
		wants  -  how you can help them achieve their objectives. <br>
		<br>
		No matter how you begin, get right to discussing the value you think
		you&#39;d bring to their organization. In fact, I&#39;ve found one of the best
		openers is to say something like &quot;Here&#39;s what I will bring to/offer
		your organization,&quot; and start describing the benefits they&#39;d
		receive in hiring you. It tells them right away why you&#39;re writing, and
		brings you immediately to communicating the value you offer. <br>
		<br>
		There are many other offbeat ways to open your letter so it won&#39;t sound
		like it&#39;s been copied out of a dull cover letter book or from the same old boilerplate material that many job seekers use.

<br><br>

		<br>
		<strong>Finish with a call to action</strong><br>
		Despite your best efforts, when the employer comes to the end of your
		letter it&#39;s unlikely they&#39;ll be left with an irrepressible urge to call
		you immediately, even if they are interested in your qualifications or employment proposal.
        They have many other things to do, and they aren&#39;t going to put everything else on
        hold and jump for the phone just because you decided to mail them a letter - even if they were
        interested in your offer. <br>
		<br>
		That&#39;s why you will usually have to initiate the follow-up communication
		yourself by picking up the phone and making a call. You should do this
		within three days of the letter&#39;s arrival, and let the employer know in
		your letter that you will be following up. This may just be enough to
		get them to hold on to your letter and maybe give it a more thorough
		reading. <br>
		<br>
		John Lucht, author of 'Rites of Passage' doesn&#39;t agree. He calls job seeker's promises to follow-up and proactiveness the &quot;Mafia approach&quot; - a threat that they&#39;d better call, or else you will. He counsels his clients to just mail r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and letters and hope some calls come in. But before you sigh in relief and decide to follow Lucht&#39;s advice, you should also know that he has his clients mail out at least 1,000 r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and tells them
		to expect only one or two offers from this. And all of his clients are senior executives with proven track records. <br>
		<br>
		Lucht agrees, however, that the biggest drawback of this approach is
		that it encourages people to &quot;hide behind the post office&quot; and not make
		contact. And what a drawback that is! The only thing that can hurt your
		work search more is to do nothing. <br>
		<br>
		End your letter with a call to action, and take responsibility for
		initiating the next step yourself. By saying you&#39;ll call in your letter,
		you&#39;re more likely to overcome the &quot;call reluctance&quot; that almost all
		sales people sometimes experience and avoid procrastinating when the
		time to call comes around. <br>
		<br>
		If you&#39;re responding to an advertised opening, you may have to be
		satisfied with a more passive approach. Organizations advertising an
		available position will receive hundreds of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and dozens of calls.
		You won&#39;t stand out from the competition by phoning, and because of the
		volume of calls they&#39;ll receive, you may be perceived as an annoyance.
		<br>
		<br>
		The very final sentence? I like to end all my letters with &quot;thank you.&quot;
		It&#39;s not necessary, but it puts a positive and clear end to the letter.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Some strategies for responding to advertised positions</strong><br>
		First of all ... good luck! You&#39;ll need it. By responding to advertised
		positions, you just about guarantee that your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and letter will end
		up in a pile with hundreds of others. From this, the employer will
		select maybe five people for interviews ... and all they have to go on
		to make this decision is your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter. <br>
		<br>
		When an employer receives this many r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, you can bet there will be a
		ruthless screening process. Eighty percent or more of the r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and
		letters may even be weeded out before any are passed along to the hiring
		manager or team. <br>
		<br>
		Often, your letter and r&eacute;sum&eacute; will be scanned by a clerk with little
		knowledge of the intricacies of the advertised position. They may have a
		checklist put together by someone in Human Resources of the specific
		experience someone decided is &quot;essential&quot; for the job. Score poorly on
		their list, and no one else will ever see your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. But you say you
		have something equivalent or better? Too bad it&#39;s not on their list.
		You&#39;re out. <br>
		<br>
		Yes, it&#39;s a tough sell. But not hopeless. Every job my wife has ever had
		she got by responding to an ad in the newspaper. I don&#39;t think she
		believes me when I say this isn&#39;t the most efficient way to look for
		work. <br>
		<br>
		First, you have to think about who&#39;s going to respond to the ad. You&#39;ll
		be selling against competition and you have to think about who that
		competition is likely to include. There will probably be r&eacute;sum&eacute;s sent in

		by people with nearly identical jobs at other, maybe smaller, companies.
		In other words, there&#39;s almost certain to be applicants who &quot;fit&quot; better
		on paper. People with more checks on the checklist. <br>
		<br>
		So what do you do? You can pretend you&#39;re a perfect fit and show how you
		fulfill all of their requirements  -  no matter how feebly. Or you can try
		to show how you&#39;ll bring something else to the position and the company
		 -  maybe something they hadn&#39;t thought of or expected. <br>
		<br>
		The strategy in selling against competition is: 1) differentiate
		yourself, and 2) help the employer feel the value he or she will gain
		from those differences. Everyone who gets selected for an interview will
		probably have the core requirements, so it&#39;s often easier to stand out
		from the competition by showing the employer the full bundle of valuable
		abilities you can offer. <br>
		<br>
		This may not make any impression on the clerk with the checklist, but
		unless you&#39;re perfect for the position as the employer has imagined it
		 -  and can prove it  -  it&#39;s probably your best chance at getting an
		interview.

<br><br>
		<br>
		<strong>Salary expectations</strong><br>
		What if you&#39;re asked about salary expectations? It&#39;s never a fair
		question. You won&#39;t learn enough from a description in an ad to know
		exactly what&#39;s involved. If the employer was really concerned about
		wasting their time interviewing people with unrealistic expectations
		they could have printed the salary range they have in mind right in the
		ad. <br>
		<br>
		You&#39;re more likely to be eliminated for saying the &quot;wrong&quot; number than
		for saying nothing. At this point, they&#39;re only trying to screen you
		out. Yes, occasionally, not quoting a number may remove you from
		consideration, but it&#39;s probably a risk worth taking. If you feel you
		have to say something, give a broad range or say &quot;negotiable.&quot;
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Format, paper, and other basics</strong><br>
		The content and organization are the most important elements of your
		letter, but presentation has an effect too. No one&#39;s going to interview
		you because your letter looks nice, but engaging and persuasive content
		combined with a professional appearance is a powerful combination. <br>
		<br>
		Here are some suggestions for improving the appearance of your letter:
		<br>
		<br>
		Paper/ink: Black ink on white paper is easy to easy to print and easy to
		read. I like white 8½&quot; by 11&quot; paper with a laid finish. Heavier paper
		has a nicer feel  -  24-pound paper with a rag content of 25% or more
		should be easy to find. But if all you have is standard 20-pound
		photocopy paper, go ahead and use it. Don&#39;t let this delay you. <br>
		<br>
		I don&#39;t think a week goes by where I&#39;m not asked about colored paper. It
		seems to be a concern for many people, so here&#39;s my opinion: <br>
		<br>
		It doesn&#39;t make any difference. <br>
		<br>
		No one&#39;s going to interview you because you used ivory paper. No one&#39;s
		going to refuse to interview you because you used light blue paper.
		White paper is just as &quot;professional&quot; as any other color. Yes, colored
		paper might stand out in a pile to a small degree, but so what? Standing
		out is no achievement in itself. Your objective is to stand out in a way
		that will improve your chances for an interview, and you don&#39;t do that
		with something as superficial as colored paper. <br>
		<br>
		If you want to use colored paper, that&#39;s fine. If it gives you a better
		feeling about the materials you&#39;re sending out, that&#39;s terrific. But
		give your reader a little more credit than to think they&#39;re so easily
		manipulated by shallow gimmicks. <br>
		<br>
		Margins: Never less than an inch  -  1¼&quot; or even 1½&quot; is better. Don&#39;t
		shorten the margins to squeeze your letter on to a single page. Either
		edit some material out or lengthen the margins and the space between
		paragraphs and go on to a second page. <br>
		<br>
		Typeface: There are thousands available, but stick to a simple serif
		font like Times Roman. You&#39;ll probably want 11 or 12 point size. <br>
		<br>
		Your name, address, and phone number with area code go at the top (see
		samples). The date comes next, followed a few lines below by the name of
		the person you&#39;re sending the letter to. Give their name, title,
		company, address, city, province/state, and postal/zip code. <br>
		<br>
		Usually, you&#39;ll want to address the letter to a person by name, and not
		just to the company or to a title. If you don&#39;t have a name, you can
		usually get one by just picking up the phone and asking: &quot;Hello, I&#39;m
		sending a package to your sales manager/controller/office
		manager/whatever. Could you tell me their name please?&quot; It doesn&#39;t
		always work, but it takes 30 seconds to try. And check the spelling of
		the name when you get it. <br>
		<br>
		You will typically address them as &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot; Don&#39;t guess gender! If
		you can&#39;t find out, just use their full name  -  Dear Kelly Smith. If you
		can&#39;t get a name, address your letter to a specific title or a general
		description of the intended reader&#39;s responsibilities  -  Information
		Systems Manager, Office Manager, Plant Manager, for example. <br>
		<br>
		After the body of your letter, close with &quot;Sincerely,&quot; or something
		similar, followed by 4-5 blank lines and then your name. Your signature
		goes in between. I rarely bother with &quot;Enclosure&quot; or a secretarial
		designation at the bottom, but if you know what these are and like to
		use them, go ahead. If not, don&#39;t worry about it.

		<strong>Sample letter #1  -  Chris McKarthy<br>
		</strong><br>
		Chris McKarthy is applying for a position as manager of a mid-size airport. The
		position was advertised nationally and will likely attract applicants
		who have managed smaller airports throughout Canada. <br>
		<br>
		Chris never managed an airport. He did look after an air-strip for a
		few years, but that amounted to little more than keeping a big field
		mowed. He&#39;ll just look silly if he tries to play up that experience. <br>
		<br>
		He may not have much of a chance anyway, but with this letter he tries
		to take the employer&#39;s focus away from the areas where he&#39;s sure to come
		up second (or 100th) best, and put it on the strengths he would bring to
		the position. Now it&#39;s up to the employer to decide whether this is
		enough to make up for his lack of experience as an airport manager. <br>
		<br>
		Also notice how Robert doesn&#39;t go into detail about his aviation
		experience. It&#39;s all on his r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but any serious applicant will also
		have a strong aviation background. So he moves the focus of his letter
		to where he expects he&#39;ll have a competitive advantage. <br>

		Danny Fishman,
		Chief Operating Officer<br />
		District of North Vancouver<br>
		55 Charles Street<br>
		North Vancouver BC V5B 0A1<br>
		<br>
		Dear Mr. Fishman: <br>
		<br>
		There are many others who have spent more time than I maintaining
		airport facilities. Although I&#39;ve been a pilot for nearly 20 years, have
		been an aviation safety officer, and have operated a specialty air
		carrier in this area for the past eight years, I expect that every
		serious candidate for this position will also have a strong background
		in aviation. <br>
		<br>
		But I think I have a lot more to offer. <br>
		<br>
		I know this region, and understand the important role the airport will
		play in our economic development. I know the airport, and many of its
		clients. I also have a vision for the future of the airport. One
		specific idea I&#39;d like pursue is convincing the cargo &amp; courier carrier
		industry to move their operations to Hillside. An aggressive marketing
		of the benefits Hillside offers to business would increase profitability
		without costly expansion. I have the experience and skills to take on
		this responsibility. <br>
		<br>
		As my r&eacute;sum&eacute; details, I have 10 years&#39; experience in senior management,
		with hands-on responsibility for everything from customer service and
		sales &amp; marketing to financial planning and personnel management. <br>
		<br>
		The creativity and innovation I have used to develop and grow my own
		business, my entrepreneurial approach and my proven sales &amp; marketing
		skills are some of the unique attributes I can bring to the management
		of the airport, along with the necessary aviation experience. I look
		forward to the opportunity of presenting some of my ideas to the
		selection committee. You can reach me at 604 777-1212 any time. Thank
		you. <br>
		<br>
		Sincerely, <br>

		<strong>Sample letter #2  -  Samantha Gainer<br>
		</strong><br>
		Samantha is responding to an ad from a pharmaceutical company looking for
		sales reps. Her formal sales experience is minimal, and pharmaceutical
		sales positions usually attract a heavy response from experienced reps.
		<br>
		<br>
		If Samantha tries to focus on her sales background she&#39;s doomed. There&#39;s no
		way she can compete on those terms with someone who has five years&#39;
		experience working a sales territory making cold calls and
		presentations. And the ad will get dozens of responses from people with
		that kind of experience. <br>
		<br>
		So she takes the focus away from sales experience and describes her
		belief in the product, her involvement in the health field, and the
		relationships she&#39;s already developed with potential strategic partners
		and customers for the company&#39;s products. <br>
		<br>
		This letter is filled with I&#39;s, me&#39;s, and my&#39;s, but I still give it a
		thumbs up. Every paragraph addresses a skill or experience that the
		employer will want to see in their reps.

		Re: Sales Representative position <br>
		<br>
		There&#39;s an adage in the insurance industry that you can tell how
		successful a salesperson will be by the amount of insurance he or she
		personally carries. If you accept that line of thinking, you&#39;ll
		understand why I believe I would be an effective representative for your
		company. Let me briefly explain. <br>
		<br>
		As a registered massage therapist, I have a strong interest in the
		health field and in promoting healthy living. For years, I have been
		taking daily vitamin, mineral, and food supplements  -  including Vista
		products. I not only use these products myself, I recommend them to my
		clients. I know first-hand that they are effective, beneficial, and
		without the detrimental side effects of drugs and other therapies. <br>
		<br>
		The health food store environment is one I am very comfortable in. I
		make it a habit to drop in on the health food stores in the areas I
		visit and stay informed of any new products. I have personal contact
		with all of the stores in the Kitchener-Waterloo area, and my practice
		also brings me into contact with naturopaths, holistic healers, and
		others who promote innovative approaches to health care. <br>
		<br>
		I have worked as a commissioned sales rep before and know how to find
		prospects and build relationships with them. I am no stranger to cold
		calling and making sales presentations. For the last six years, I&#39;ve run
		my own practice and my success has been completely dependent on my
		abilities to develop a customer base. <br>
		<br>
		May I have the opportunity to further discuss how I might contribute to
		your organization during a personal interview? I can be reached at
		519/555-1212 any time. Thank you. <br>

		<strong>Sample letter #3  -  Lesley Waite<br>

		I love this letter. You may find the style too brash and pompous (my
		wife did), but I see it as an employer-focused breath of fresh air. And,
		in the real world, this letter did its job and got the interview. <br>
		<br>
		Lesley puts a powerful spotlight on the value he can deliver to the
		employer. And he sells the interview by promising &quot;specific examples&quot;
		and thorough references. The opening is attention grabbing, he focuses
		on the benefits he will deliver, and he gives just a bit of evidence to
		justify his claims (it&#39;s the r&eacute;sum&eacute;&#39;s role to provide the evidence in
		detail). <br>
		<br>
		This really does everything I think a cover letter should do. <br>

		Re: Sales Manager opportunity <br>
		<br>
		There&#39;s no shortage of people who can &quot;talk the talk.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Now that you&#39;ve scanned through a stack of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, you know that all
		too well. Profit gains, sales increases, winning key accounts  -  all
		these achievements are described on my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but you&#39;ve been reading
		over those kind of claims for the last hour. Everyone seems to be able
		to find statistics which make them look like the real deal. <br>
		<br>
		So let&#39;s get down to business. You&#39;re looking for aggressive strategic
		growth. I can help you achieve your goals. Here&#39;s some of what I&#39;ve done
		for others and will do for Zilcos: <br>
		<br>
		Seizing opportunities, making contact, cultivating relationships, and
		getting results  -  usually over fierce competition. <br>
		Planning sales targets &amp; strategies, and implementing account management
		processes that focus on customer satisfaction &amp; commitment ... with
		bottom-line accountability. <br>
		<br>
		Holding my own with a client or prospect&#39;s CEO and senior executives in
		face-to-face meetings and presentations. And coaching others to do the
		same. <br>
		Building and focusing a skilled and motivated sales team.<br>
		Currently, I develop new business for one of Canada&#39;s most respected
		marketing agencies. In the last year alone, I&#39;ve brought in over a dozen
		strategically targeted new accounts. I&#39;ve proven throughout my career
		that I create new business, develop existing accounts, and cultivate
		client loyalty. I can do it for you. <br>
		<br>
		I&#39;m very good at what I do. You&#39;d expect me to say that, but when we
		meet I can provide specific examples to support this conclusion  -  and
		you can get references from senior managers at any company I&#39;ve worked
		with to confirm the value I&#39;ve consistently created. <br>
		<br>
		A few minutes of your time will go a long way in convincing you that I
		have something to offer. Together, we will achieve breakthrough sales
		results. Please call me any time at 519/123-9876 and we can arrange a
		time to meet. Thank you. <br>
		<br>
		Sincerely, <br>

		<strong>Final word</strong><br>
		The problem with all guides to r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and cover letters is that they
		may make you believe there are absolute rules which must be followed.
		When your own efforts fall short of what&#39;s described in the books, it&#39;s
		easy to become paralyzed because you&#39;re convinced that what you&#39;ve done
		isn&#39;t good enough. <br>
		<br>
		I&#39;ve never seen a perfect r&eacute;sum&eacute; or cover letter. I&#39;ve never written
		one, and you probably won&#39;t either. But perfection isn&#39;t the goal.
		Strive for excellence  -  but remember that while you&#39;re sitting around
		tinkering with your letter, other people are out getting work with
		letters and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s that are far weaker than what you had to begin with.
		<br>
		<br>
		Keep these tips in mind, then go with whatever you come up with. <strong>Be
		persistent and make contact</strong>!

<h2>Write an Attention-Getting R&eacute;sum&eacute;</h2>

		<p class="addspace">If you realize that a great r&eacute;sum&eacute; can be your
		ticket to getting the exact position you want, you will be able to
		muster some genuine enthusiasm for creating a real masterpiece.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is a tool with one specific purpose: to win an interview</strong>.
		Like a response to a Request for Proposal (RFP), a r&eacute;sum&eacute; is intended to
		show that you have successfully performed and produced results in the
		capacity required and that you are qualified for a face-to-face
		interview. <br>
		<br>
		Again like an RFP response, the selection committee will quickly and
		without bias, make a decision whether or not they will take the next
		step and meet with you to hear your presentation. The reader wants to
		see a compelling reason to take the time to meet with you. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>The most successful r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are those focused on key and quantifiable
		accomplishments</strong>. Accomplishments and achievements differentiate the
		average performer from the one that truly delivers results. At best, a
		reader will only skim through your document. R&eacute;sum&eacute; skimmers get
		distracted by unnecessary detail, wordiness, generic statements and
		information that is too high-level. The reader is looking for
		performance statements. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Avoid &quot;job description&quot; filler or low value content</strong> and focus on
		personal accomplishments. Job descriptions are the reason a person is
		paid a base salary. Accomplishment statements will describe how a sales
		person earned their commissions or what outstanding results a manager
		contributed to earn their bonus.<br>
		<br>
		In today&#39;s job market a r&eacute;sum&eacute; built on simply a job description is not
		competitive. Job descriptions provide the reader with a list of
		functions and no results. A potential employer is not interested in what
		was expected from you - they want to know how well you performed against
		those expectations.<br>
		<br>
		Example: &#39;Managed six direct reports&#39; is a job description. &#39;Increased
		sales by 14% in twelve months by leading a team of six inside and
		outside people to exceed sales forecasts&#39; is an accomplishment
		statement.<br>
		<br>
		Many employers are only interested in viewing r&eacute;sum&eacute;s written in reverse chronological order, listing
		your most recent employment first, and working backwards. A functional r&eacute;sum&eacute;, one that groups skills and abilities can frustrate the reader because they do not know when or where you performed the results.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>R&eacute;sum&eacute; Checklist</h2> Make sure to include: <br>
		<br>
		<strong>OBJECTIVE</strong> - one sentence explaining what kind of work you
		wish to do. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>PROFILE</strong> - A brief three to four sentence overview /
		summary of who you are and what you offer the potential employer. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</strong> - reverse chronological order. If you have
		held more than one position at a company, list them separately with
		dates.
		Include all awards, recognition and accolades. If you have several, list
		them in a separate section entitled AWARDS &amp; RECOGNITION following your
		employment history section. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>EDUCATION</strong> - is always listed AFTER your work history. Recent
		graduates/students list their education before their work history. Make
		sure you include dates. Post graduate degree is listed above all of your
		&quot;continuing education&quot;, training, seminars, courses, etc. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>LENGTH OF r&eacute;sum&eacute; </strong>- if you have less than ten years experience, two pages
		is advised. With more than ten years experience you never exceed three
		pages. If your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is very long it will not be read. Edit it to
		include only the information that is relevant to the position for which
		you are applying. <br>
		Bullet points get read - paragraphs do not. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>DO NOT use first person pronouns</strong> - I, my, mine, we, us, our, etc. <br>
		Use a consistent verb tense to begin each of your accomplishment
		statements - preferably past tense - Exceeded, Increased, Oversaw, Won,
		Achieved, Led, Acted, etc. <br>
		<br>
		On another note, one of the most common mistakes we see in r&eacute;sum&eacute;s at
		the managerial and executive level is the omission of context in
		professional experiences.
		<br>
<br><br>
<a href="#anchorPagetop" onclick="smoothScroll();return false;"><img height="19" border="0" width="20" title="Go to top" src="images/top_of_page.gif"/>&nbsp;Top of page</a>
<br><br>

		<strong>Why is context important in your r&eacute;sum&eacute;?</strong><br>
		<br>
		1. Whenever you make a r&eacute;sum&eacute; reader work hard to figure out your
		potential value and fit, you are likely not going to benefit.<br>
		<br>
		2. R&eacute;sum&eacute;s are selling documents and context at the company, role, and
		career path levels can be additional arrows in your quiver.<br>
		<br>
		3. Fit is a subtle but important thing. You are helping highlight where
		you do indeed fit through context.<br>
		<br>
		When you leave the reader of your r&eacute;sum&eacute; guessing who your employer was
		(industry/sector, ownership (public, private, family business, etc.)
		size, market position), the chances are that they won&#39;t guess. They will
		just move on to the next r&eacute;sum&eacute;. <br>
		<br>
		If you have worked with recognizable names, market leaders, etc. use
		that to your advantage. If you haven&#39;t, make sure that you sell your
		past employers. If the person hiring doesn&#39;t know and therefore doesn&#39;t
		value where you worked, then you have a big problem.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>You also want to place your role in the context of the company you
		worked for</strong>.
		A Marketing Manager, for example, might have reported to a Sr. Marketing
		Manager, a Director of Marketing, a VP, or even the President. That same
		marketing manager might be one of several marketing managers or the only
		marketing person in the company. It is vital that you place your role in
		context.<br>
		<br>
		The best r&eacute;sum&eacute;s describe a theme, or thread through the candidate&#39;s
		career path. The various experiences and education should show
		someone who knows where they are going and a story explaining why the candidate made certain choices, and
		more importantly, why they are being interviewed for this opportunity.

	          <br>
	          <br><br />


	          <h2>Interview Pointers</h2>

		<p class="addspace">Although you may spend an hour or more in an
		interview, in fact the interview is really over in five minutes. If you
		have not convinced the interviewer within the first five minutes that
		you are the right person for the job (or at least a contender who should
		be taken to the next level), it can be next to impossible to recover.
		Recoveries do happen, but they are very rare.<br><br>In that first five minutes of the interview, expect the interviewer to have noted your appearance, your grooming, your handshake, your personal
		presence, your eye contact, your articulation and most importantly, your
		personality. It is the &quot;soft factors&quot; that will take you to the next
		level. Conventional wisdom holds that being late for a job interview is
		an automatic black mark against a candidate, as is showing up on time
		with only a very sketchy knowledge of the company&#39;s business.<br><br>The next level starts with your ability to “sell" your experience, background and value proposition. Your job is to ensure that the
		interviewer hears where you bring value to the business, in both the
		short and long-term as well as how quickly will you “ramp up" and
		provide results. Fifty-seven percent (57%) of hiring managers say they
		would pass over inarticulate candidates or those candidates that are
		vague about their previous experience. If an candidate is a vague
		communicator in an interview, chances are that he or she will not
		communicate well on the job either.<br><br>It is important to be prepared so that you can verbally articulate your
		“value add". If you have done your interview homework and have fully
		researched the company and where you “fit", the words will flow
		smoothly. If not, it will show. This is where a positive attitude and
		demonstrated confidence will establish the tone for the interview. This
		is also where you have the opportunity to make your personal connection
		with the interviewer. The clearer and more specific you can be, the more
		likely an interviewer is to be impressed.

<br><br>

        There are many kinds of questions asked in interviews. Two key styles include: <br><br><strong>Behavioral questions</strong> <br>
		This type of question includes &quot;Can you give me a
		specific example of how you did that?&quot; or &quot;What were the steps you
		followed to accomplish that task?&quot; Its purpose is to anticipate
		predictable future behaviors based upon past responses. <br>
		<br><strong>Competency questions</strong> <br>
		This type of question includes &quot;Can you give me a
		specific example of your leadership skills?&quot; or &quot;Explain a way in which
		you sought a creative solution to a problem.&quot; Its purpose is to align
		your past behaviors with specific competencies which are required for
		the position. <br>
		<br>Behavioral and competency interviewing is gaining greater acceptance by
		trained interviewers because past performance is the most reliable
		indicator of future results, especially when it is tied to the specific
		competencies for the position. Always provide examples and stories. That
		makes you a real person with real experiences. Real experience benefits
		a future employer. <br><br>The following is the list of the top ten critical success factors that
		nearly every employer is seeking: <br>
		<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Positive attitude toward work <br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Proficiency in field of study <br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Communication skills (oral and written) <br>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Interpersonal skills <br>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Confidence <br>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Critical thinking and problem solving skills <br>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Flexibility <br>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Self-motivation <br>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Leadership <br>10)
		Teamwork <br>
		<br>Show your competence in as many of the above critical success factors as
		possible and you will rise above the competition.<br><br><strong>One of the worst &quot;sins&quot; an interviewee can commit is to speak in generalities rather than specifics</strong>. It is not enough to say, &quot;I&#39;m a very
		goal-oriented person.&quot; <strong>You have to back it up with specifics</strong>.
		<br>
		<br>
		For
		example: &quot;I&#39;m a very goal oriented person. In fact, I regularly update a
		list of personal and business goals with specific time frames. Since I
		started keeping this goal list three years ago, I&#39;ve successfully
		reached or surpassed over 95% of these goals. I&#39;m confident that the
		other 5% are also within reach in the coming year.&quot;<br><br>

	          <h2>Uncovering an Employer&#39;s Corporate Culture is a Critical Task for Job-Seekers</h2>

		<p class="addspace"><strong>Why should job-seekers care about a potential employer&#39;s corporate
		culture?</strong><br>Aren&#39;t there more important factors to consider, such as the
		job itself, salary and bonuses, and fringe benefits? These factors are
		indeed important, but increasingly career experts are talking about the
		importance of employee-employer fit in terms of culture, with the idea
		that how well the employee &quot;fits&quot; the culture can make the difference
		between job-search success and failure.<br>
		<br>
		What is corporate culture? At its most basic, it&#39;s described as the
		personality of an organization, or simply as &quot;how things are done around
		here&quot;. It guides how employees think, act, and feel. Corporate culture
		is a broad term used to define the unique personality or character of a
		particular company or organization, and includes such elements as core
		values and beliefs, corporate ethics, and rules of behavior. Corporate
		culture can be expressed in the company&#39;s mission statement and other
		communications, in the architectural style or interior d&eacute;cor of offices,
		by what people wear to work, by how people address each other, and in
		the titles given to various employees. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>How does a company&#39;s culture affect you?<br>
		</strong>In many, many ways. For instance: <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;*
		The hours you work per day, per week, including options such as flextime
		and telecommuting. <br>
		&nbsp;*
		The work environment, including how employees interact, the degree of
		competition, and whether it&#39;s a fun or hostile environment - or
		something in between. <br>
		&nbsp;*
		The dress code, including the accepted styles of attire and things such
		as casual days. <br>
		&nbsp;*
		The office space you get, including things such as cubicles, window
		offices, and rules regarding display of personal items. <br>
		&nbsp;*
		The training and skills development you receive, which you need both on
		the job and to keep yourself marketable for future jobs and employers.
		<br>
		&nbsp;*
		Onsite perks, such as break rooms, gyms and play rooms, daycare
		facilities, and more. <br>
		&nbsp;*
		The amount of time outside the office you&#39;re expected to spend with
		co-workers. <br>
		&nbsp;*
		Interaction with other employees, including managers and top management.
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>How do you uncover the corporate culture of a potential employer?</strong>
		<br>
		The truth is that you will never really know the corporate culture until you
		have worked at the company for a number of months, but you can get close
		to it through research and observation. Understanding culture is a
		two-step process, starting with research before the interview and ending
		with observation at the interview. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Before the Interview</strong><br>
		Before you&#39;ve even been invited for an interview, you might consider
		doing an informational interview with the company. Informational
		interviewing is a great research and networking tool.<br>
		<br>
		Once you&#39;ve been invited for an interview, while you are researching the
		company for the interview, spend some time searching for clues about the
		company&#39;s culture. Review the company&#39;s annual report, web site, and
		other materials. Some companies even discuss their corporate culture on
		their web site.

<br>
<br>
<a href="#anchorPagetop" onclick="smoothScroll();return false;"><img height="19" border="0" width="20" title="Go to top" src="images/top_of_page.gif"/>&nbsp;Top of page</a>
<br><br>

		<br>
		<strong>At the Interview</strong><br>
		Experts suggest arriving early to the interview - unannounced if
		possible - and spend the time observing how current employees interact
		with each other, how they are dressed, and their level of courtesy and
		professionalism. <br>
		<br>
		During the interview, you should <u>consider asking one or more of these
		questions to get a feel for the corporate culture</u> - as well as gain key
		information you&#39;ll need to make a decision if a job offer is made to
		you: <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;*
		How are decisions made - and how are those decisions communicated to the
		staff? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		What role does the person who gets this position play in
		decision-making? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		Does the organization emphasize working in teams? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		What are the organization&#39;s priorities for the next few years? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		Are there established career paths for employees in this position? <br>
		<br>
		If you get a chance to meet with other employees (or make your own
		chances by finding out where they hang out), you can ask one or more of
		these questions to try and get a handle on an organization&#39;s corporate
		culture: <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;*
		What 10 words would you use to describe your company? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		What&#39;s it really like to work here? Do you like it here? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		How are employees valued around here? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		What skills and characteristics does the company value? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		Do you feel as though you know what is expected of you? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		How do people from different departments interact? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		Are there opportunities for further training and education? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		How do people get promoted around here? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		Around here what behaviors get rewarded? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		Do you feel as though you know what&#39;s going on? <br>
		&nbsp;*
		How effectively does the company communicate to its employees? <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong><br>
		The bottom line is that you are going to spend a lot of time in the work
		environment - and to be happy, successful, and productive, you&#39;ll want
		to be in a place where you fit the culture. A place where you can have a
		voice, be respected, and have opportunities for growth.

              <br>

              <h2>Cover and Broadcast Letters</h2>

		<p class="addspace">A Cover or Broadcast letter accompanies your r&eacute;sum&eacute; to introduce you to
		a prospective employer as a knowledgeable and capable applicant. You may
		wish to send your application package by overnight delivery to show the
		urgency and importance you place on being of service to the company.<br>
		<br>
		Cover letters are used when applying to a specific, advertised position.
		Remember, a maximum of 20% of the positions available at any one time
		are advertised (&quot;visible&quot; job market), so do not limit yourself to these
		jobs. The position you want may not be advertised for a long time, if
		ever. You will have many competitors who are also trying to obtain an
		interview. In fact, 90% of all job seekers are applying to the 20% of
		advertised jobs!<br>
		<br>
		Broadcast letters are used to uncover opportunities in organizations.
		Jobs in the &quot;hidden&quot; job market can be found most easily by speaking
		with people (for more information regarding the &quot;hidden&quot; job market,
		review the Networking section of this paper). Through your
		contacts, you should be able to get the names and addresses of people
		who hire for the work you would like to do. Targeted employer
		directories like the JobPro Directory and company and industry
		association web sites are also good resources to use to discover
		which organization might hire. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Strategies</strong><br>
		The quality of your letter will determine the employer&#39;s first
		impression of you. Do your research so that you can clearly articulate
		your competitive advantage. This letter should summarize only job relevant information,
		particularly your work experience (paid and volunteer), education, accomplishments, and
		job skills. The letter highlights
		the most important information while your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is more comprehensive.<br>
		<br>
		Write down ideas as you think of them. Then analyze the material,
		organize it into themes, and write in complete sentences incorporating
		those themes into paragraphs. Stress the contributions you can make to
		the employer. Highlight achievements and how they are transferable to
		the job you are applying for. <br>
		<br>
		From your research or the advertisement,
		note words such as &quot;required, must have, very desirable, proficient in&quot;,
		and pay special attention to pointing out your strengths in these areas.
		<u>Use action verbs, but do not repeat verbatim what is in your r&eacute;sum&eacute;</u>.
		Avoid using negative words or mentioning negative ideas. Stress the
		qualifications you have for the job rather than mention those you do not
		have. Avoid words such as &quot;although&quot; and &quot;however&quot; because you will set
		up a negative statement.<br>
		<br>
		In a broadcast letter, choose the phrasing of your job objective
		carefully. If you are too narrow, you may not be considered for some
		positions, but if you are too broad, you may be perceived as being
		unfocused or indecisive, just wanting any job. When sending letters into
		the hidden job market, don&#39;t send hundreds because you will not be able
		to do the necessary research. <br>
		<br>
		The response rate does not justify the
		time and cost. Concentrate initially on 15-20. Then expand to the next
		group of 15-20. More organizations are using equipment to scan r&eacute;sum&eacute;s
		into their database. You can therefore increase the number of company
		contacts you are targeting, but only to the quantity of <u>quality</u> applications you
		can produce.

<br>
<br />
<br>
		<strong>Details That Matter<br>
		</strong>Use high quality 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; paper (same stock as your
		r&eacute;sum&eacute;) <br>
		<br>
		Ensure a neat, uncluttered and well-organized appearance <br>
		<br>
		Edit your draft for clarity, tone, accuracy, proper spelling,
		punctuation and grammar <br>
		<br>
		Send your letter and r&eacute;sum&eacute; unfolded in a large envelope <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Similarities Between Cover and Broadcast Letters</strong><br>
		Cover and broadcast letters are similar, and you should include the
		following elements in both:<br>
		<br>
		Focus on your strengths; highlight them in such a way that the employer
		can clearly see a connection with their organization <br>
		<br>
		Give proof, using examples with specifics such as dollars or numbers, to
		show that your assessment of your capabilities is accurate <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Differences Between Cover and Broadcast</strong> <strong>Letters</strong><br>
		Address and send to the person or office specified in the advertisement
		<br>
		<br>
		If no name is included in the advertisement, do try your very best to
		obtain the name of the person receiving applications so that you can
		address your letter to a person rather than to an office <br>
		<br>
		In your first paragraph, state the job title from the advertisement and
		mention the benefits you bring to the organization or position <br>
		<br>
		After you think the employer has received your application, telephone to
		restate your interest in an interview and to inquire about the interview
		process and dates <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Broadcast</strong><br>
		Address and send to the head of the department you want to work in <br>
		<br>
		If the organization is small, send to the President, Executive Director,
		or whomever is in one of the top positions <br>
		<br>
		In your first paragraph, based upon your research, mention the job title
		or area you are interested in, what you can offer that they need, and
		what it is about that organization that appeals to you <br>
		<br>
		Include the name of the person(s) (with their permission) who gave you
		the information <br>
		<br>
		Advise that you will initiate, stating how and when; do not leave the
		responsibility for arranging follow-up to the employer.

					  <br>
					  <strong>What Message are You Trying to Communicate?<br>

					  </strong>The main message you need to communicate to an

              <ul>
  <li>
    Claims  -  &quot;Here&#39;s what I can do for you. Here&#39;s the
    value I can deliver to your organization.&quot;
  <br>
  &nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    Credibility  -  &quot;Here&#39;s why you should believe me.&quot;  </li>
              </ul>
                      <p class="addspace">You cover letter will usually focus on claims. Your r&eacute;sum&eacute;&#39;s role is to restate the substance of your claims
						and to provide the credibility needed to support them.
						<br>
						<br>
						Most job search coaches will tell you to focus on the
						employer when writing your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, even though you&#39;re
						writing about yourself. Knowing that this is what you&#39;re
						supposed to do is the easy part. The challenge is to
						do it convincingly. <br>
						<br>
						Begin by thinking about the employer&#39;s needs, desires,
						and expectations, and follow a path back to yourself.
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">In
						writing your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter, keep the following
						in mind</span>:<br>
						<br>
						1) What do they want to achieve? <br>
						<br>
						2) How will the work you see yourself doing help them
						achieve these objectives? To reach their goal, what will
						they need that you can provide? <br>
						<br>
						3) How will their customers benefit? (Preferably the
						organization&#39;s customers, but possibly &quot;internal&quot;
						customers as well.) <br>
						<br>
						4) What would someone who could do these things look
						like on paper? <br>
						<br>
						5) What else might they want that you could do that they
						may not be expecting? <br>
						<br>
						<br>
						You don&#39;t get hired by describing your past. You get
						hired by painting a picture of the employer&#39;s future and
						making them believe that you can help them achieve it.

<br>
<br>
						<strong><br>
						Focus on the Future in Your R&eacute;sum&eacute;<br>
						</strong><br>
						Your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is organized in a way that makes it seem
						like it&#39;s about your past. To the casual reader, it&#39;s a
						list of what you&#39;ve done. But this is an illusion. You
						take your source material from your past, but the focus
						is on the future  -  the employer&#39;s desired future. Your

						propose to benefit their organization  -  once your
						&quot;claims&quot; are stated, they can begin to interpret your
						credibility.  <br>
						<br>
						You create credibility by probing all aspects of your
						experience, abilities, traits, and beliefs for
						information that will support that claim. Credibility is
						established with specific details, provided in context
						so the reader can get a mental image of you. <br>
						<br>
					You can also foster credibility through fresh, vivid
						expressions of beliefs and traits that will be perceived
						as more genuine than tired words taken out of a book.
						This is always &quot;says you&quot; material, but how you say it
						can make a big difference in whether it&#39;s believed.&nbsp;
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Don&#39;t Try to Tell the Whole Story</strong><br>
						<br>
						Don&#39;t try to tell the whole story in your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Say just enough to whet the
                        appetite of the right person. This will encourage contact. Needed details can be provided during
                        an interview.
                        <br>
						<br>
						Examine your self-marketing documents such as biographies, r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and portfolios.
                        These are your personal representatives. Does the information in your r&eacute;sum&eacute; reflect
                        what you want to do in the future? Is it presented in a way that will hook a prospective
						employer? Do your cover letters address solutions employers need? <br>
						<br>
						Consider sending personal letters to hiring managers
						instead of typical cover letters and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.&nbsp; Be clear about what
						you want for yourself in terms of building your career,
						and also in terms of what you can do for employers. With
						this in mind, personalize your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letters, and <u>send
						them only to named individuals who are directly involved
						in the hiring decision</u>. Remember to avoid company gatekeepers so that you
						can make your talents and interest in their company
						known to decision makers.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Stay Energized and Positive</strong><br>
						<br>
						If you have let things slide, now is the time to
						accelerate your efforts. Build mental muscle by talking
						about your desires and goals. Just as your body&#39;s
						muscles become stronger with repetition, your mental
						picture of your desired outcome will become more real
						every time you repeat it. <br>
						<br>
						If you&#39;re unemployed, resist the temptation to isolate
						yourself. Don&#39;t spend your days sending e-mails and
						r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. This can make you feel productive, but the lack
						of response from employers can lead to self-criticism
						and depression. Change your schedule so your days are
						spent calling contacts, arranging meetings and attending
						events that allow you to meet more people. Save evenings
						for Internet follow-up activities. Set goals and track
						your accomplishments. Keep a success calendar and post
						your big and small achievements in it each day. <br>

              <h2>Aggressive Job Search Strategies</h2>
                      <p class="addspace">
						<strong>Assess your progress and measure your results to
						avoid the trap of being busy but unproductive.</strong><br>
						<br>
						</strong>Looking for a new job can be extraordinarily
						taxing - scouring classifieds, searching the web and
						mass-mailing your r&eacute;sum&eacute; will usually produce unsatisfactory
						results, despite the intense time and personal effort.					  </p>
                      <p class="addspace"><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The issue may not be the amount of
						work you put into
						your job hunt, but the type of work</span>. Now, there isn&#39;t an
						easy way to find a job - you are still going to have to
						work hard at it. But the following principles of an
						aggressive job search can lead you to bypass the
						classifieds and HR departments and get in front of
						employers.<br>
						<br>
						<span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #FFFFCC">
						Don&#39;t waste time mass mailing r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and spending
						hundreds of hours
						searching job sites</span>. Instead, <strong>do some company
						research and begin targeting employers</strong>. Then,
						knowing something about the company and how you can help
						them, <strong>call the person who hires people with your
						talent. Do this because cold-calling works to find you
						job openings and to get you interviews and jobs. <br>
						<br>
					Bonus: </strong>You should expect better-than-average
						cold-calling results when your &quot;cold-calls&quot; are warmer than most,
						after you have taken the time to learn about the
						employer&#39;s needs and thought how you can apply your
						talent and experience toward solving their problems.<strong><br>
						<br>
						<br>
						As part of leading an aggressive job search/career-building campaign targeting employers to find jobs in the &quot;hidden job
						market,&quot; consider the following job search tips:</strong><br>
						<br>
						1.  <strong>Measure your job search progress and use proven methods to find
						work</strong><br>
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"><br>
						Are you
						regularly getting called for interviews?</span> Unless
						you are known to and liked by people (often called
						bosses) having the power to
						hire you, you need interviews to find employment. <strong>If employers are not calling you for interviews, then
						you need to find what part of your job search needs
						changing, and quickly change it. </strong>Either your cover
						letter or r&eacute;sum&eacute;, or job search
						methods, or amount of time and effort you put into your
						job search, or a
						combination of these needs to be strengthened. <br>
						<br>
						The idea is to be aware of and use proven job search methods to avoid the trap of being
						busy but unproductive. However, if you are getting
						interviews but no job offers, you need to improve your
						interviewing skills. Interviewing is perhaps the only
						job search topic not addressed by this paper.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						2. <strong>Be in control<br>
						</strong><br>
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Aggressive
						career building works on the basis that you are
						in control. The idea is to be primarily targeting
						employers instead of passively applying only to companies
						advertising job openings</span>. This aggressive,
						proactive approach to your job search will help
						you find better paying, more interesting jobs which build
						your career. Keep in mind that career building takes
						time, and that you may need to occasionally apply for and
						work &quot;filler&quot;
						jobs to be able to pay your bills during your
						search for better quality, more rewarding employment.&nbsp;
						<br>
						<br>
						Before you can begin targeting employers as part of an
						aggressive job search, you need to select your
						targets. Start by
						actively researching prospective employers and put
						together an initial list. You might create your list
						based on several factors, including how interested you
						are in the company&#39;s projects, current job openings,
						company size, location, reputation, rate of pay, whether
						it&#39;s union or non-union, and whether you know people
						there who can help you get hired. Your research results
						will help you include and rule out companies. <br>
						<br>
						Focus on targeting a manageable number of companies to
						avoid being overwhelmed and becoming bogged down by
						&quot;information overload.&quot; If done thoroughly, the work of
						selecting about twenty-five
						companies for your initial list should keep you busy for
						several days. You likely will need to refine your list
						over the course of your job search based on what you
						learn, as some employers that at first appeared
						important will likely end up being removed, while other
						employers get added.<br>
						<br>
						Then, once you have a list of employers you are
						targeting, you need to consider which job search methods
						are most likely to result in interviews.<br>
						<br>
						As mentioned later in this paper, successful job seekers recommend
						using a number of methods to keep
						your job search active and increasingly effective.
						Proven job search methods include:
					  <ul>
						<li>
						<p class="addspace">sending r&eacute;sum&eacute;s both by email and by regular mail<br />
						  cold calling to make initial contact and to arrange interviews<br />
						  making your talents known to employers before they
						advertise a position through &quot;information interviews&quot; -

						stay tuned for more on information interviews later in
						this paper<br />
						<br />
						dropping off your r&eacute;sum&eacute; in person while trying to meet people
						having the power to hire you						<br />using follow-up phone calls, emails and printed letters
						including &#39;thank you&#39; notes
						</li>

			  </ul>
					  <p class="addspace">You need to know which of these techniques are most
						effective in your job search, because experts warn that
						you can only employ no more than about five of them
						simultaneously without &quot;casting your net too wide&quot;
						and reducing the quality of your job search campaign. <br>
						<br>
						Targeting employers also means reading the business press and
						industry journals specific to those companies. Their web
						sites and those of related industry associations may
						also provide you with a &quot;heads up&quot; about possible job
						opportunities.&nbsp;Try to
						find out what expansion plans the company has. Is
						management refocusing its target market? What companies
						is it partnering with? <br>
						<br>
						The challenge then will be to ferret out the potential jobs
						and learn who can get you in the door. Remember to not take
						on more work than you can do in a quality way, because the
						idea behind waging an aggressive, planned, high quality job
						search is to make you stand head and shoulders above other job
						applicants. The key to your job search success rests much more
						on your perceived quality than on the quantity of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s you send
						out, or the number of positions you apply for when your focus isn&#39;t
						on demonstrating how hiring you translates into investing in their business.

<br>
<br>

						<br>
						3. <strong>Know the people and companies<br>
						</strong><br>
						News articles, corporate web sites, press releases and
						personal contacts can lead you to the people you really
						want to talk to at your target company. Also, talking
						with vendors, customers and employees of your target
						company will - directly or indirectly - lead you to
						upcoming jobs and opportunities. Your aim is to gain
						insight into how you may be able to help them and also
						to find out who are that company&#39;s decision makers
						having the power to hire you. <br>
						<br>
						<br>
						4. <strong>Make your move</strong><br>
						<br>
						Call the decision maker(s) at each company you are
						targeting. Explain who you are, who referred you, and
						what you know about the company. Ask for an
						informational interview or a short meeting in which you will demonstrate
						your ability to contribute to their bottom line. If you
						are prepared to offer ideas and solutions they need, you
						will be far ahead of other job seekers who only send
						their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. When you meet them, listen carefully, so
						that you can fully respond to their questions and
						concerns. Remember to be respectful of their time.<br />

                <strong>Change Your Job Search Strategy</strong>
              </p>
					  <ul class="centertextlevel2" id="ChangeJobSearchStrategy">
		<p class="addspace">What if 80% of what you&#39;re doing every day in your job
		search is a total waste of time? Well, it&#39;s true, according to the
		Pareto Principle.<br>
		<br>
		Here&#39;s the explanation:<br>
		<br>
		Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923) was an Italian economist who found that 20%
		of the Italian people owned 80% of that country&#39;s wealth. But what&#39;s
		fascinating about his discovery, also called the 80/20 Rule, is that its
		implications go far beyond economics.<br>
		<br>
		Examples: 20% of your carpeting gets 80% of the foot traffic ... 20% of
		any sales force produces 80% of sales ... 20% of your customers cause
		80% of your problems, etc.<br>
		<br>
		In other words, a small number of causes produce a large percentage of
		effects, in a ratio of about 20:80.<br>
		<br>
		What does this mean for your job search?<br>
		<br>
		About 20% of what you do accounts for 80% of your results. Conversely,
		80% of what you&#39;re doing to find a new job is producing only 20% of your
		results  -  it&#39;s largely a waste of time.<br>
		<br>
		So, to get hired faster, you must focus like a laser on the 20% of your
		actions that produce 80% of your employment leads. It&#39;s that simple.<br>
		<br>
		Here are three ways to do just that ...<br>
		<br>
		1) <strong>It&#39;s the Network</strong><br>
		The observations of many career
		development practitioners/employment counselors point to up to 80% of
		job leads coming from networking.<br>
		<br>
		Bottom line: if you&#39;re not spending up to 80% of your time expanding
		your network, talking daily to friends, colleagues, family and new
		contacts about the job you seek and the value you can deliver ... you&#39;re
		screwing up.<br>
		<br>
		Turn it around. Change your priorities. Make time to network every day
		 -  starting today.<br>
		<br>
		2) <strong>Begin Your R&eacute;sum&eacute; Forcefully</strong><br>
		Recognize that the opening
		lines of your r&eacute;sum&eacute; must grab readers by the lapels and force them to
		keep going. Typically, that has to happen within the first 15-30
		seconds. Otherwise, you&#39;ll lose out to more compelling candidates. Every
		time.<br>
		<br>
		So, in the top 20% of page one, clearly tell employers what you can do
		for them and why you&#39;re the one to do it. Back your claims with specific
		facts and figures that are easy for busy readers to grasp  -  no puffy
		language or empty assertions, please.<br>
		<br>
		When you do this, and fire off your big guns early, you&#39;ll be 80% of the
		way toward getting employers to read your entire r&eacute;sum&eacute; ... and call you
		for an interview.<br>
		<br>
		3) <strong>Make the Best First Impression at Every Interview</strong><br>
		Where do
		80% of your results in the job interview come from? You guessed it  -
		the impression you make in the first 1-2 minutes  -  the opening 20%.
		<br>
		Here&#39;s good news: the first 20% of every interview is largely under your
		control. You decide what clothes to wear, how to groom yourself, when to
		leave so that you arrive on time, how to smile and shake hands, what
		opening words to say, questions to ask, etc.<br>
		<br>
		So prepare thoroughly and treat the opening 20% of your job interview
		like the golden opportunity it truly is.<br>
		<br>
		OK. You understand the Pareto Principle and its effect on your job hunt.
		Now, here&#39;s your homework assignment. Sit down and add up how you&#39;ve
		spent your time over the past 5-10 days. What 20% of your activities
		have produced 80% of your employment leads? Do more of them. What 80% of
		your efforts have been unproductive? Stop doing them, or delegate them.<br />
		<br>

<br>
<br><br>
					  </p>
              </ul>
<h2>Focus Three Times to Get that Job!</h2>
					  <p class="addspace">Focus and repetition are two key part of every
						successful advertising campaign. It&#39;s how billions of
						dollars in cars, coffee, cookware  -  you name it  -  are
						sold.<br>
						<br>
						Why not borrow this strategy for your job search?<br>
						<br>
						In your case, create an attractive, focused theme for
						yourself, then repeat it three times  -  in your r&eacute;sum&eacute;,
						your job interview and the thank-you letter(s) you send.
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Focus in your r&eacute;sum&eacute;:
						</span> <br>
						Employers only want to solve problems and grow profits<br>
						<br>
						</strong><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">About 90% of all r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and cover letters are
						doomed to produce only a fraction of the results they
						could</span>. <br>
						<br>
						Why? Because they&#39;re centered solely on the desires of
						the job seeker. The underlying message of the typical
						r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter is this: &quot;Give me a job where I
						can get promoted and make more money.&quot; When in reality,
						your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter must say this: &quot;Dear Mr. or
						Ms. Employer, I understand your problems. Here&#39;s how I
						can help you solve them and increase your profits.&quot; <br>
						<br>
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Everything you say in every document you send out that&#39;s
						connected with your job search must be centered on the
						needs of the employer</span>. Because no employer wants to hire
						you. Employers only want to solve problems and grow
						profits. If you can help them do that and tell them so
						in your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, cover letter and job interview, you will
						enjoy massive success in your job search and in your
						career! <br>
						<br>
						When writing your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, remember to tell employers
						exactly what you can do. Don&#39;t force them to figure it
						out for themselves. <br>
						<br>
						The best way to do this is to start your r&eacute;sum&eacute; with a
						clear objective. It shows that you know exactly what job
						the employer is trying to fill. Example:<br>
						<br>
						<strong>OBJECTIVE</strong><br>
						Restaurant Manager where more than 10 years of
						experience in food service and management will add value
						to operations.<br>
						<br>
						If you don&#39;t know the job title, focus on the 2-3 skills
						you want to use, which gives you the flexibility to
						apply for different positions. Example: <br>
						<br>
						<strong>OBJECTIVE</strong><br>
						Position where more than 12 years of sales, management
						and operations experience will add to profitability. <br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Focus in your job interview</span></strong><br>
						<br>
						Use the job interview to reinforce the theme you
						developed in your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Be sure you are able to
						elaborate on every point in that r&eacute;sum&eacute;.<br>
						<br>
						If you focused on the skills of sales, management and
						operations, for example, have additional facts, figures
						and/or letters of recommendation that you can share with
						interviewers to prove you have those skills. <br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Focus in your thank-you letter</span></strong><br>
						<br>
						Follow the same logic in your post-interview thank-you
						letter. Get the correctly spelled name of everyone you
						met in the interview, either from business cards or the
						receptionist. <br>
						<br>
						For best results, write your letters in the lobby before
						leaving and drop them in the nearest mailbox. That way,
						they&#39;ll arrive the next day.<br>
						<br>
						In your thank-you letters, reinforce the skills and
						character traits you&#39;ve already talked about in your
						r&eacute;sum&eacute; and job interview. This is a final opportunity
						for you to hammer home the advantages of hiring you!<br>
						<br>
						Every successful advertiser knows that focus and
						repetition produce results. If you focus on 2-3
						attractive skills/traits and reinforce them in your
						r&eacute;sum&eacute;, job interview and thank-you letters, you&#39;ll see
						results in your job search.<br>
						<br>
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">It is ABSOLUTELY
						CRITICAL that you send a thank-you letter after every
						job interview, addressed to every person you met at the
						company</span>  -  including the receptionist. <br>
						<br>
						Get a business card from every person you encounter, so
						you spell their names correctly. Write and mail your
						thank-you letters the same day you interview, so that
						they arrive the next day.<br>
						<br>
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">If you skip this
						EASY step</span>, which will set you apart from 75-90%
						of other job seekers,
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">you are limiting
						your job search to only 10-25% of its potential</span>,
						assuming other job seekers&#39; r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, cover letters and
						interviews are as good as yours.<br><br>

              <h2>Job Application Follow-up Recommendations and R&eacute;sum&eacute; Follow-up Methods</h2>
                      <p class="addspace">
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The following
						r&eacute;sum&eacute; follow-up methods are more aggressive than what
						any company&#39;s Human Resources department or other
						&quot;gatekeepers&quot; will suggest,
						and should be employed as part of an effective job
						search campaign aimed at effectively targeting
						employers.						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Try this:</strong><br>
						<br>
						1) <strong>Print and send a
						stationery version of your cover letter and r&eacute;sum&eacute; by &quot;snail mail&quot; to the
						hiring authority, along with copies to other company
						contacts</strong>.
						Make sure to address each copy using their
						correctly-spelled name and title. Your cover letter is
						especially important in making your application stand
						out, and following the cover letter and r&eacute;sum&eacute;
						guidelines included in this document will go far toward
						getting them to phone you to arrange an interview.<br>
						<br>
						2) One day after you expect the employer to receive your
						r&eacute;sum&eacute;, <strong>
						e-mail them a quick note to ask that they confirm that
						they received it. Also ask if you can assist them in
						assessing your qualifications by
						supplying them with additional information such as your
						portfolio, or by answering any questions they may have. </strong>
						Doing this increases the chance that they will call you
						for an interview.<br>
						<br>
						3) <strong>One week after sending your first email, ask
						for a convenient time to contact them for a brief phone
						interview. <br>
						</strong>Whatever method you use,
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">your goal in
						following up aggressively is to sell your abilities and
						experience. Gently push for the face-to-face interview as soon
						as possible to get that job!</span> <br>
						<br>
						The reason for pushing for a face-to-face
						meeting at this point is because employers like to hire someone they know, like and trust.
						Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way they can know you in a meaningful way if they
						haven&#39;t met you in person. You may have the best r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter
						they&#39;ve seen, and
						sound great on the phone, but they still likely need convincing you&#39;re the
						best person
						for the job. <br><br />

                      the job to someone and gotten an acceptance, but the
                      person may change their mind and never start the job. Or
                      the person may take the job but prove to be
                    unsatisfactory. It happens more often than you think.</p>
                    <p class="addspace">So, what does the
                      employer do when they face this situation? They groan,
                      roll their eyes, and take another look at the applicants
                      who <i>almost</i> got the job. Why? Because they really
                      don&#39;t want to start from scratch, post the job, review the
                      r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, etc. Filling a job takes an employer a lot of
                      time and energy. Staff time for interviews plus the cost
                    of posting the job, etc. is expensive for most employers.</p>
                    <p class="addspace">This is where your
                      thank you note comes in handy. It reminds them of you

                    <p class="addspace">Thank you notes are
                      so rare that they are very effective. And, a thank you

                      probability that it will pay off may be less than 10%, but
                      that probability may show a higher return on the
                      investment of your time than any other job search action
                      you take that day.<br>

              <h2>How can other people help me get a job?</h2>
              <p class="addspace">The most effective way to get a job in Canada is through
						the
						“network" of people you know. Your network includes
						family,
						friends, neighbours, colleagues, class mates, teachers…
						even people
						you meet on the bus or at the store. The more people you
						talk to,
						the bigger your network gets, and the more chances you
						have to<br>
						get a job in your field.<br>
						<br>
						For example, your dentist might ask what kind of job you
						have.
						You tell her, and she says her brother works in the same
						field, and
						may need a new employee. She gives you her brother&#39;s
						phone
						number and tells you to call him and mention her name.
						When
						you do that, you&#39;re using your network, or “networking."<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Why do I need to network?</strong><br>
					In Canada, only 20 to 30% of jobs are advertised. Most
						are part
						of what is called
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">the “hidden" job market</span>. You hear
						about them
						through the network of people you know.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Why does it work this way?</strong><br>
						When jobs are advertised, employers have to take the
						time to
						review sometimes hundreds of applications, interview
						candidates
						and then hire a stranger. In most cases, <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">they would
						rather hire
						someone who comes to them through a contact they trust.</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						This can make it difficult to find out about jobs -
						especially for new
						immigrants who don&#39;t have local networks. This is true
						for people
						who move or change professions, too. You need to have a
						network
						where you live, connected to your professional field.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Should I only use networking to get a job?</strong><br>
						No. Networking is important, but it&#39;s not the only way
						to get a job. You should apply for advertised positions, too, and
						use other methods listed here. The more different
						things you try, the better your chances of finding a
						job.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Does networking work for professional jobs?</strong><br>
Yes. The more skills and responsibilities involved in a job, the more an employer relies on networking to fill the position.

<h2>Building A Network of Contacts To Find Better Employment Faster</h2>
<br>
Networking to build your career is about getting to know and become known by people. One of the fundamental rules of career development is to never stop networking, and never stop growing and expanding your network of contacts. Many people think that networking is only for when you're actively (or about to be actively) job hunting, but the truth is that you should never stop networking.

As you talk with people in your network, you're not asking for a job. The point of networking is to share useful information WITH THE AIM OF HELPING OTHERS. That's right. AIM TO HELP OTHERS build their careers, and you may be surprised by what they do to help you build yours.
<br><br>
As part of networking, you can  build your brand within your network - and use your network to communicate that brand to others.

Besides keeping in regular touch with your network, you should also be looking for ways to build your network, such as by attending trade shows or conferences and mingling. You can also build your network through online social (think Facebook.com) and professional (think LinkedIn) networking sites.

Doing this takes time, so start as soon as you can - ideally before you move to British Columbia.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Networking by association</strong><br>
						A good place to start is with your professional association. Check out their website and contact them directly to find out what kinds of services they offer. Some associations have programs and services	specifically for internationally-trained&nbsp;professionals. Some do not.<br>
						<br>
						But all professional associations have information that
						can help.&nbsp;
						For example, some have job postings or work experience programs. Some associations also have events where you can meet other people in your field.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Networking tips</strong><br>
						Get yourself some contact cards. These are like business cards
						and list your name and contact information. Most print shops will make cards for you for a small fee.<br>
						Give your contact cards to people every chance you get. Ask for their business cards, too.<br>
						Tell everyone you know that you are looking for a job. Tell them what you do and what skills you have. If you don&#39;t tell them, they can&#39;t help you.<br>

                      <h2> Do What Works for Others</h2>
                      One great shortcut to success in your job search (or
						anything else in life) is to simply do what&#39;s working
						for others.<br>
					  <br>
					  The	best way to sell yourself may be to talk less and listen
						more.
						Employers will often tell you exactly what they&#39;re
						looking for during an interview. <br>
					  <br>
					  Start by doing four simple things:<br>
					  <br>
					  1) <strong>Network with everyone you know</strong>: friends, family,
						former co-workers, college counselors. <br>
					  <br>
					  2) <strong>Do not put all your eggs into one basket</strong>. Keep
						looking regardless of your successes and failures.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
					  3) <strong>Treat your job search as a full-time job</strong>.<br>
					  <br>
4) <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"> <strong>Focusing during job interviews on how you can solve
					  an employer&#39;s problems</strong></span>. When you think about it, that&#39;s the
						only reason jobs are created  -  to solve problems. If
						you can demonstrate that you&#39;re a problem solver who can help them, you can get hired, in any economy. <br />
						<br />
						<h2>
						<br>
					  Top Three Tips to Help You Get Hired Faster</h2>
					    <p class="addspace">



						</strong>1) <strong>Networking works</strong><br>
						The most important advice is this: the vast majority of
						jobs are found and secured via word-of-mouth referrals
						 -  networking.<br>
						<br>
						In other words, tell everyone you know about your job
						search. And know this: there&#39;s no shame in being between
						jobs. People want to help you. But they can&#39;t help if
						you keep your job search a secret!<br>
						<br>
						You never know who might have a lead on a job opening,
						or might know someone who is hiring. And, when you&#39;re
						networking, don&#39;t overlook your past professional
						associates.<br>
						<br>
						That means you should go through your Rolodex, your
						email address book, the desk drawer where you keep
						business cards, etc. Write down the name of everyone
						you&#39;ve done business with in the last 10-15 years.<br>
						<br>
						You should have no trouble coming up with 200-300
						contacts this way.<br>
						<br>
						The biggest error people make is not keeping business
						cards. One of the first things you should do is call up
						past or current vendors, sales reps who&#39;ve called on
						you, competitors and associates from past jobs. This
						information is a gold mine.<br>
						<br>
						But how do you approach people to ask for job leads?
						What should you say?<br>
						<br>
						You could say &quot;Hi, this is Joe. It&#39;s been about 9 months
						since we last spoke and I hope you&#39;re well. I&#39;m calling
						today because I need your help. I&#39;m looking for a
						position in IT management and I thought of you right
						away.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						If the person you call can&#39;t provide any job leads, ask
						the magic question: <br>
						&quot;Who else do you know that I should be talking to?&quot; Then
						call that new person right away.<br>
						<br>
						Everyone loves to help . but you have to ask. Far too
						many folks are ashamed to be out of work. Don&#39;t be  -
						you have lots of company! Millions of people just like
						you are searching for a new job today.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						2) <strong><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">You MUST meet people having the power to hire you</span></strong><br>
						Here&#39;s another dose of the obvious: computers don&#39;t hire
						people. People do.<br>
						<br>
						Chances are, unless you get face to face with the hiring
						manager, you will not get the job. After creating a
						top-notch r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter, your next major goal
						should be to meet hiring managers at companies you want
						to work for.<br>
						<br>
						If you&#39;re searching for a job locally,



						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">a powerful way to
						increase your odds of meeting a hiring manager is to
						pick up the phone and call</span>.

<br>
<br>
<a href="#anchorPagetop" onclick="smoothScroll();return false;"><img height="19" border="0" width="20" title="Go to top" src="images/top_of_page.gif"/>&nbsp;Top of page</a>
<br>
<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Call Them!</strong><br>
						Never just send your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and leave it at that. Call
						and speak to your targeted contact. If he or she answers,
						explain why you are calling. Tell them why you are
						perfect for the job and ask for a meeting. Typically they
						will ask you to just send your r&eacute;sum&eacute;.<br>
						<br>
						But don&#39;t let that stop you.<br>
						<br>
						An excellent response is this: &quot;I could send you my
						r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but I&#39;m going to be about five minutes from your
						office tomorrow around noon. If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like
						to stop by and drop it off. When I do, I&#39;ll ask for you.
						If you&#39;re available, I can introduce myself and
						personally give you my r&eacute;sum&eacute;. If you&#39;re not available,
						I&#39;ll just leave it with the receptionist. Would that be
						OK?&quot;<br>
						<br>
						This strategy will produce more face-to-face meetings
						with hiring managers, and can dramatically reduce your
						time looking for work.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						3) <strong>Finding a job is a full time job</strong><br>
						If you&#39;re like most out-of-work people, you&#39;re probably
						frittering away your time on activities that will never
						get you hired. That&#39;s the most common mistake I see.<br>
						<br>
						Think about it.<br>
						<br>
						The last time you were employed, you worked 8 hours a
						day, 40 hours a week. If you continue to work the same
						number of hours searching for a better job  -  and I
						would argue that you should work even harder  -  you
						would have spent 160 hours last month in your job
						search.<br>
						<br>
						Did you? Probably not.<br>
						<br>
						So treat your job search like the full-time job it is.
						Devote at least 40 hours a week and 160 hours a month to
						your job search. Nothing less.<br>
						<br>
						It used to be that most of us only looked for work a few
						times in our life, and so before it was less necessary
						to know how to best go about your job search, and also
						finding work was easier for most workers. However, in
						today&#39;s job market, it really pays off to take time to
						educate yourself about what goes into an effective job
						search, and learn job search skills like how to write a
						killer r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letters, the importance of networking
						and how to do it, and how to meet hiring
						managers.<br>
						<br>
						To recap,<br>
						1) <strong>Networking works</strong>. Don&#39;t overlook the contacts
						you&#39;ve amassed in your current and past jobs, and tell
						EVERYONE about your job search<br>
						<br>
						2) <strong>You can&#39;t get hired if you don&#39;t meet with hiring
						managers</strong>, so make it a priority to get your foot in
						the door and get &quot;face time&quot; with people who can hire
						you.<br>
						<br>
						3) <strong>Finding a job is a full-time job</strong><br>

			  <h2>Cold Calling: What It Is and Why You Need to Cold Call Employers</h2>
		              <p class="addspace">

						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Study after study has proven that, hands down, cold
						calling employers is superior to all other methods</span>.
						Just remember to make your cold calls a little warmer by
						researching targeted employers. This should shorten your
						job search and allow you to find better employment than
						if you simply apply only to jobs that are advertised.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>An example of how cold calling helps you get hired
						sooner</strong><br>
						The firm JIST Works, in Philadelphia, trained 1,000 job
						seekers in cold calling during the last recession, in
						1990. These 1,000 people were trained to devote 25 hours
						per week to their job search and cold call employers to
						ask for a face-to-face meeting. As a result, 66% of them
						were employed within 2.3 weeks and 90% of the rest were
						employed within 90 days.<br>
						<br>
						In another study, from 1992 to 1998, over 700 disabled
						job seekers were trained to spend at least 17.5 hours
						per week cold calling employers. 90% found jobs within
						90 days.<br>
						<br>
						Cold calling is simply a good way of making direct
						contact to set up an interview. It works for anyone,
						from entry-level job seekers to CEOs.<br>
						<br>
						To succeed, you must stop seeing yourself as a job
						seeker and think of yourself instead as&nbsp; someone making a
						business proposal. Instead of thinking: &#39;Please
						give me a job,&#39; think: &#39;Here are all the important things I
						can do for you.&#39; Just as in your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter, be sure to
						answer the question: Why should I hire you?<br>
						<br>
						Try to connect with a decision maker <u>above</u> your
						future boss. This is important, as the person directly above you may, and often is,
						threatened by such a call. They may figure, &quot;If this
						person is so assertive NOW, they may be after MY job in
						the future&quot;. Regardless of which level of
						management you decide to contact, aim to talk to someone
						having the power to hire you to avoid being referred to
						Human Resources.<br>
						<br>
						Try the following example script to get started. Begin
						by asking their permission to briefly tell them about
						yourself. This is necessary because there&#39;s no sense in
						explaining what you can do for them if they are unable
						to take your call, or not interested in talking to a
						potential new employee. If they agree to talk with you,
						show your respect for them by being careful not to take
						more of their time than they agreed to spend talking to
						you. <br>
						<br>
						&quot;Hello, my name is _________.&nbsp; May I have a
						few minutes of your time to tell you about what I can do
						for (company name)?<br>
						<br>
						I have _______ years&#39;
						experience as a ____________, specializing in
						_____________ and ____________.&nbsp; I have a
						(certificate, B.A., M.S., X years experience) in _______________ and
						recently completed (name a recent successful project
						with a measurable result).&nbsp; Would you be interested
						in meeting with me to discuss what I can do for (company
						name)?&quot;<br>
						<br>
						As explained in the next section, the idea behind cold
						calling them is for you to get to know decision makers
						working for companies you are targeting, and for these
						decisions makers to get to know you, so that even if
						there are currently no job openings, your talent will
						become known to them, increasing the likeliness of them
						hiring you later. <br>
						<br>
						At the same time you get to know them,
						they get to know you, and, if everything goes well, they

						will also begin to like and trust you.&nbsp; This is
						important, because, as you know, employers are most
						interested in hiring someone <strong>they know, like and
						trust</strong>.&nbsp; Cold calling as the initial stage of
						networking is important, as employers can not get to
						know you well enough to be comfortable hiring you simply by reading your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter. <br>
						<br>
						The words in the above telephone script are so simple that you may feel foolish
						saying them at first. &quot;At first I didn&#39;t feel
						comfortable using the script. It seemed wooden,
						without spontaneity,&quot; says a computer hardware engineer.
						&quot;Then I discovered it doesn&#39;t really matter how you say
						it  -  rote, friendly or funny  -  the words just seem to
						work. I got four interviews in 20 minutes.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						Cold calling works. It just takes courage and practice
						to implement it into your overall strategy. Make sure to
						practice your script out loud a few times before calling
						employers.<br>
					  </p>
		              <p class="addspace">Cold calling has about 1 in 20 success ratio, in
						general. Of course, 19 &#39;Nos&#39; on the phone may hurt more
						than 1,000 rejection letters, but you&#39;ll hear it less
						often. Just make those calls until you connect! Making 20 phone calls to get one job
						interview with a company you want to work for is much
						more effective than spending months sending r&eacute;sum&eacute;s
						and getting no response.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
			  <h2>More about the Importance of Cold Calling</h2>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Taking the Initiative</strong><br>
						When you research an organization and take the
						initiative to contact them, you are <em>demonstrating</em>
						initiative. It demonstrates you can take charge, are
						independent, and a creative thinker. You&#39;re not just
						following the pack and doing the standard job search,
						you are taking it one step further. (And yes, you may
						still be checking ads, but they don&#39;t need to know
						that.) It&#39;s important to do your homework and make sure
						you really understand what they do, and why they do
						it--and then communicate that to them in your initial
						contact. <br>
						<br>
						<strong>Build Relationships</strong><br>
						Building your career and finding employment or better
						employment is about building <em>relationships</em>.
						When you make that cold call, and then ideally find
						yourself face to face with someone in the organization,
						you are creating a relationship that can lead to either
						something there, or elsewhere. More often than not,
						people are genuinely receptive when you approach them
						about their work. <br>
						<br>
						Proactively contacting organizations can result in what
						may appear as serendipitous timing. You never know when
						the person on the other end may say, &quot;Funny you should
						call now. We were just talking about our need for a new
						communications specialist.&quot; Or, &quot;We are about to launch
						a new project and actually have not posted the job yet
						it.&quot; If you can get in before the onslaught of
						respondents to an ad, you have all the more advantage.
						You also have the edge of having chosen <em>them</em>
						based on their work, rather than anonymously responding
						to an ad. <br>
						<br>
						<strong>Get in the driver&#39;s seat.</strong><br>
						And finally, being proactive can help you feel more in
						control over your own life. Gazing at job listings, and
						competing with hundreds of other applicants can be very
						demoralizing. But more importantly, you can lose sight
						of your real gifts and offerings when you are just one
						of many applicants. Psychologically, playing the job
						listing game is taxing on self-esteem and morale.
						Deciding what organizations you would love to work for,
						investigating who would be best to contact, and
						presenting yourself, can do wonders to remind you of
						what you want to be doing. <br>
						<br>
						Some things to consider with proactive job hunting:					  </p>
		              <ul>
						  <li>Conduct preliminary research on what
							organizations are in your field of interest. Compile
							a list, and begin your research. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
						  <li>Note which ones capture your attention, stir
							your imagination. Which have the kind of personality
							and verve that grab you? <br>
&nbsp;</li>
						  <li>Begin informal research, and ask anyone you know
							if they know someone who works there. This kind of
							networking is invaluable in terms of getting a
							specific name and contact, and ideally, a referral
							from someone they know. It makes you one degree less
							anonymous. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
						  <li>Strategize on how you see yourself fitting in,
							and what you have to offer the organization. Review
							their organizational mission and projects, and
							articulate this fit in specific terms, using their
							language and terminology if necessary. <br>

						  <li>Consider proposing something new, if you

						  <li>Follow through after the meeting. More often

<h2>More About Why You Need to Cold Call Businesses and How to Do It</h2>

		<p class="addspace">You read all about it: networking, referrals, information interviews and
		other job search techniques. These methods require time, energy and determination. More powerful than any one of these methods to get your
		foot in the career door of your choice is cold calling - the art of
		uninvited job-hunting. <br>
		<br>
		Hiring is
		expensive. By cold calling, you&#39;re saving the company time, money and
		resources by placing yourself on a platter for them to consider even
		before any advertisement has been launched.
		<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">By cold calling, you are doing
		them a favour</span>.<br>
		<br>
		And even if there are no immediate vacancies available, you gain by
		getting a vital contact name and inside company information, such as
		how exactly the company recruits. <br>
		<br>
		Cold calling or calling employers
		directly can be difficult for most people unless you&#39;re born with a
		sales talent and a &quot;thick skin&quot;. Cold calling means making contact with
		people whom you have not had any previous contact and selling yourself
		in such a way that you set up an interview for yourself or convince them
		to keep you at the top of their minds should a position become
		available. <br>
		<br>
		Some people say it&#39;s like a radio ad: Concise, to the point, focused at
		meeting the employer&#39;s needs, charismatic and informative about
		yourself. The key to cold calling is to be prepared for anything. At any
		point in the process, you could find yourself dealing directly with the
		person responsible for hiring. You must always be ready to sell
		yourself and your skills. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Where Do I Start? </strong><br>
		There are several parts of the cold-calling process. Each part has some
		similarities to what professional telemarketers do when preparing to
		market their product: <br>
		<br>
		1. <strong>Craft yourself a list of choice employers</strong><br>
		The first step in this process is compiling at list of all companies
		that you are interested in working for. You can source for
		this list via your personal network, the yellow pages, corporate
		web sites, business listings from industry publications and even your
		local Chamber of Commerce directory. A business directory with
		company and contact information is what you need. <br>
		<br>
		You could create this list of companies by focusing on a specific
		location, particular industry, etc.
		Do some research into the career opportunities in your field with each company as far as possible before progressing
		further. This ensures that you don&#39;t waste your time with organizations
		that won&#39;t be able to match your career goals. <br>
		<br>
		Once they pass this test, narrow your search to an address, contact name
		and number/email of the hiring manager or supervisor in the department
		of your choice. If these are not indicated in directories or websites,
		try to find contact information for someone in the company other than
		the gatekeepers in Human Resources who is willing to provide you with the name and
		contact information of the person responsible for hiring. Doing this is
		important, as in many cases, both the receptionist and the Human
		Resources staff will have orders to keep you from talking to people having the power to hire you.<br>
		<br>
		2. <strong>Practice selling yourself / pitching your talent</strong><br>
		Your pitch is your personal introduction. To ensure you&#39;re not
		tongue-tied at the crucial point of a telephone conversation, prepare a
		short script to guide you on your self-introduction to the prospective
		employer. A simple outline includes an introduction, an explanation of
		your purpose, summarizing three top skills you possess pertinent to the
		type of job you are inquiring about, finding about immediate or
		potential vacancies, asking if you might send them a copy of your r&eacute;sum&eacute;
		or arrange an interview date. <br>
		<br>
		A pitch allows you to relax and focus on what you need to say and how to
		say it prior to calling an employer. Be sure to relate your previous
		professional experience with what this new company needs. You may have
		more than one pitch that you refer to depending on the type of job that
		you are applying for. <br>
		<br>
		3.<strong> Practice makes perfect</strong><br>
		Telephone etiquette is extremely important in cold calling as this is
		your first point of contact with the prospective employer. So don&#39;t get
		sloppy! Here are some tips to help you get it right:<br>
		<br>
		Practice your script either with a friend or another job seeker, making
		him/her work through different scenarios as the secretary or employer.<br>
		Tape record yourself to ensure you come off as calm, clear and
		confident. <br>
		Identify yourself. Don&#39;t assume the person you are calling will
		recognize your voice or that the secretary has passed on your name. If
		you were referred by someone else, mention their name. <br>
		<br>
		Talk to the right person (the hiring authority) at the right time. Be
		aware that businesses have busy or inconvenient times when they would
		not appreciate a phone call: for example, 12:00 noon just before lunch
		or at the end of the month for accounting firms. <br>
		<br>
		Keep control of the conversation. If the person you want is not in,
		never leave a number and passively wait for your call to be returned.
		Inquire about another time to call and promise to call again later. <br>
		<br>
		Put on your good phone voice. Don&#39;t mumble or shout. Talk at a moderate
		pace. Be friendly and precise. <br>
		Get down to business. People don&#39;t have time for small talk, so get to
		the point briefly. <br>
		<br>
		In your passion to be heard, don&#39;t forget to listen - it&#39;s a two-way
		thing. Remember, you need to motivate your listener to pave the way for
		you, so listen when they are speaking. Take notes if that will help you!
		If you can&#39;t provide answers to questions asked spontaneously, tell them
		you&#39;ll get the answers and call them back when you say you will. <br>
		<br>
		Ask for a meeting (interview) at a definite time, yet do it as &quot;lightly&quot;
		as possible. Give them alternative options, for example: &quot;Would
		Wednesday morning or Thursday afternoon be more suitable for you, Mr.
		_______?&quot; If the employer informs you that there are no positions
		available, ask for an informational meeting to find out more about the
		company. That will help you get to know more people within the company
		and make connections for future use. <br>
		<br>
		Get it down on paper. Write brief notes while on the phone to record
		what was discussed and agreed upon between you and the contact and when
		it took place. Memory is a fleeting thing. Don&#39;t rely solely on your
		memory. Transfer this to your job tracking sheet so that you are always
		on the right page should a contact call back. <br>
		<br>
		4. <strong>Prep your cold call toolkit</strong><br>
		Before you pick up the telephone, make sure you have the following in
		hand: your pitch, company research notes, a copy of your relevant
		r&eacute;sum&eacute;, a calendar, pen and paper, your &quot;contact tracking&quot; sheet
		formatted for notes on the date, time, person, company, address,
		telephone, reason for calling, follow-up date, interview date/time, and
		comments. <br>
		<br>
		5. <strong>Practice getting past gatekeepers</strong><br>
		One of the hardest parts of the process is reaching the person who does
		the hiring. Secretaries or operators are there to screen calls for busy
		individuals. So, a few methods are beneficial in bypassing these
		gatekeepers. One of them is to take advantage of automated &quot;dial the
		extension of the person you want&quot; features. <br>
		<br>
		If you do not know what it is, connect at random and courteously ask if
		they can connect you to the person you&#39;re after. It may take several
		calls before you compile enough information to find the right person.
		Remember, this won&#39;t work unless you&#39;re pleasant and nice to the other
		person, who may be busy too. So use this technique carefully. <br>
		<br>
		6. <strong>How to break the ice</strong><br>
		Be genuine. Try to avoid reading a script like most telemarketing people
		do, and open the conversation with intelligent points. Knowledge of
		company projects underway and intended areas of expansion and
		development is crucial to breaking the ice with an employer. <br>
		<br>
		For example: &quot;I remember reading recently that the company was bringing
		out a new product to the market. I must say, after reading the
		specifications on this product (try naming the product if you know what
		it&#39;s called) I am really looking forward to its launch. I&#39;ve worked in
		the field of marketing in this industry and I know the potential of this
		product. I want to be a part of the team to work on this product and I
		know that I can contribute a great deal of expertise towards the
		marketing campaign. Is your company looking at expanding its Product
		Marketing team for this upcoming launch?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		7. <strong>When the going gets tough... Answering tough questions</strong><br>
		“Why should we hire you?&quot; &quot;How will your experience help my team?&quot; &quot;What
		proof can you give me that you can generate revenue for this company?&quot;
		Reading off a r&eacute;sum&eacute; won&#39;t help you answer these tough questions. You
		have to anticipate them and know how to respond in a relevant manner.
		<br>
		<br>
		8. <strong>Don&#39;t let it get you down or take negative responses personally</strong><br>
		Be prepared for negative responses but don&#39;t let &quot;No&quot; be the end of your
		conversation if you believe that you have a future with this company.
		Never argue. Practice sidestepping objections by presenting alternative
		ways to fill a need with your skills. By preparing for common
		objections, you stand a better chance of swaying negative attitudes to
		place your candidacy in a better light. Should the end of the discussion
		be a dead end despite your efforts, use this experience to prepare for
		your next cold call. <br>
		<br>
		9. <strong>When to move on to another targeted employer</strong><br>
		Be true to your mission - an appointment for an interview or application
		details - and don&#39;t hang up until you&#39;ve either achieved the goal or
		exhausted all possibilities. <br>
		<br>
		10. <strong>Wind down by following up</strong><br>
		If ever there was a time to be true to your word, this is it. Make sure
		you follow up with that fax, or call, email that response, send in those
		documents or call back at a better time. This is a representation of
		your respect for the company and contact, and a measure of your
		professionalism. <br>
		<br>
		Regardless if on any particular day your cold calling efforts result in
		interviews, or a new job, you can only win: new
		inside contacts or valuable information on company culture, the hiring
		process, hiring cycles or practices.		</p>
		                </ul>
		              <br>
					  <strong>Cold Calling Summary</strong>
					  <br>
					  To sum up, cold calling can dramatically shorten your
						job search by putting you in direct contact with
						employers who can hire you.

						You&#39;ll have much less competition, because almost all job seekers would rather answer
						classified ads than be assertive and proactive.<br />

<h2>
						Three Job Hunting Tactics for Hard Times</h2>
</strong>
					  1) <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Don&#39;t take every help-want ad at face value</span>, as some employment ads are written to prevent all but the
						most gung-ho job seekers from applying. <br>
					  <br>
					  Reason? To prevent a flood of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s that would take
						days to read, some employers purposely place ads that
						ask for unrealistic qualifications.<br>
					  <br>
					  For example, there was a help-wanted ad for a shipping
						clerk that read like a shopping list. They wanted
						someone with a college degree (master&#39;s preferred), able
						to lift 300 lbs., type 50+ words a minute  -  it went on
						and on.<br>
					  <br>
					  So, how do you overcome such an obstacle?<br>
					  <br>
					  You might take the direct approach and go to the company
						and say, &#39;Here I am!&#39; and that God herself couldn&#39;t meet
						all their qualifications, but if they wanted a top-notch
						shipping clerk, I was their woman.&quot;<br>
					  <br>
					  2) You may be more qualified than you think; don&#39;t
						underestimate yourself. <br>
					  <br>
					  3) Rejection letters can be a good thing<br>
					  Your response to a letter of rejection may, incredibly,
						get you the job.<br>
					  <br>
					  Because, when a hiring panel interviews several
						applicants but still can&#39;t decide on one candidate, they
						may send out rejection letters to test the mettle of
						those job seekers.<br>
					  <br>
					  Most people will tear up the letter and go on to other
						things.<br>
					  <br>
					  However, a more productive approach would be to thank
						the company for their time and reaffirming your strong
						desire to work for them.<br>
					  <br>
					  You can do great things in your career if you exercise
						persistence, politeness and a little street smarts.<strong><br>

					  <h2>How to Write Prospecting Career Letters</h2>
					  Here&#39;s a question I hear regularly, especially in this
						economy  -  &quot;There&#39;s a company I want to work for that&#39;s
						not advertising any job openings. What kind of cover
						letter can I write and send to them?&quot;<br>
					  <br>
					  The good news is, you don&#39;t have to wait for a company
						to advertise openings before applying to them. In fact,
						simply identifying a target company puts you ahead of
						most job seekers, who only know that they want a job ...
						and not much else.<br>
					  <br>
					  Use this to your advantage.<br>
					  <br>
					  Start by defining what you want to do for your desired
						company. What department do you want to work in? Sales?
						Information Systems? Customer Service? <br>
					  <br>
					  Next, find out the name of the person you&#39;d be working
						for. You can look through the company&#39;s Web site for
						organizational charts, often found under &quot;About Us&quot; or a
						similar link. Or, just pick up the phone and call to get
						that manager&#39;s name.<br>
					  <br>
					  Once you have the name of your potential boss, it&#39;s time
						to write your cover letter.<br>
					  <br>
					  The more customized and specific your letter is, the
						better. Be sure to research the firm and learn as much
						as possible about THEIR problems, which are YOUR
						opportunities. This will help you propose solutions that
						make employers sit up and take notice. <br>
					  <br>
					  Here&#39;s an example prospecting letter for the position of
						Customer Service Manager, sent unsolicited to a targeted
						employer.<br>
					  <br>
					   - <br>
				      <br>
					  Dear Mr. Jenkins,<br>
					  <br>
					  How often have breakdowns in your customer service
						resulted in lost business and costly headaches?<br>
					  <br>
					  I can help you.<br>
					  <br>
					  I&#39;ve been following your firm, Best Electronics, for
						some time. As you will see from my enclosed r&eacute;sum&eacute;, I
						know how to manage teams of customer service reps for
						maximum productivity. <br>
					  <br>
					  My experience has shown me how to train and motivate
						staff to identify and meet the needs of even the most
						demanding customers. This will greatly increase loyalty
						among your RU-233 customers in particular, given the
						fact that your competitor, Spiffy Systems, has recently
						introduced a lower-priced, similar product. <br>
					  <br>
					  Because you will undoubtedly need expertise of this
						kind, I hope you will be able to take my call next
						Tuesday at 10:00 to discuss your needs and how I might
						benefit Best Electronics.<br>
					  <br>
					  Sincerely, <br>
					  <br>
					  Janice Chow

			  <h2>How to Write Employment Proposals &amp; Motivate Employers To Hire You When They Have No Plans to Hire Anyone</h2>

			  </ul>
					  <p class="addspace">


						<strong>The Proposal Process - Five Important Steps</strong>
                        <br>
						<br>
						<strong>Determine Your Specialty by Recognizing Your Value</strong>
						<br>
						Look at your interests, experience and abilities. What is the valuable or unique skill or expertise you can offer  employers? Call this your 'specialty.'
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Build a  List of Prospective Employers</strong><br>
						After you have determined your specialty, use your knowledge of the industries and specific companies and non-profit organizations within them to create an initial list of employers most likely to need you. There are many ways to  find them, including by scanning the pages of trade journals and newspapers, through online searches,  using business lists,  asking people, etc.
						If you are new to your field, you may find it useful to get ideas from industry insiders and even the  librarian at your local library on which organizations to include in your list. <br />
						<br />
						Need even more help building your list and live in British Columbia's Lower Mainland? Then contact one or more of the province's many  job search assistance organizations for help with this task.
                        Joining a job club can also help you focus on building your career while working with others to identify job openings.<br />
						<br />
						Job seekers/career builders in British Columbia can also use the <a href="http://www.jobprodirectory.com" title="">JobPro BC Employers Directory</a> (JobPro) to create a list of potential employers.
                         JobPro is designed to help you  find employers  valuing your specialty while limiting your search results to a manageable number, so you can focus on targeting only the most interesting employers within any specified industry by city, postal code/partial postal code, and even street. <br>
						<br>
						<strong>Talk to Your Prospects and Build Your Network as Part of Researching Employers</strong><br>

This is your chance to do face-to-face research - a "reality check" to confirm that the career advancing opportunities you think exist based on your initial employer research actually exist. As part of confirming your findings, ask several prospective employers about the challenges they face in their organizations. Their answers will help you learn more about what is happening in their industries and  confirm their needs and interest in you as a solution provider.
<br />
<br />
 JobPro has the employer contact names, titles and direct contact information you need to contact them to arrange these &quot;information interviews,&quot; and enables you to do employer research to find the company and industry information you need to convince company decision makers that it's to their advantage to meet with you.<br />
<br />
Can you identify these employers' 'special needs' - both today and in the near future? Answering this question should help you identify realistic job opportunities with your short-listed employers, and one way of motivating decision makers you're targeting to meet with you is by asking them if they are interested in taking 20 minutes of their time to explore the idea of you doing a project for them which will solve one or more of their  problems and make them money.</p>

<br />

					  <p class="addspace">
						<strong>Decide On A Project For Each Prospect</strong>
                        <br>
						For each prospective employer you target, decide on a
						project  making use of your skills and expertise which will directly benefit the employer and
						address their needs. The project must be definable
						and achievable. Start small by considering projects which
						can be accomplished quickly to give you an opportunity to demonstrate the quality of
						your work while minimizing risk to the employer.<br>
						<br>
						For example, if you have strong word processing skills
						and a computer at home, you might offer to provide word
						processing assistance from home. As an extra service,
						and perhaps to make your proposal unique, you could even
						offer to pick up and deliver all work for the company on
						a daily or weekly basis, whatever seems most appropriate
						for the particular situation.<br>
						<br>
						Maybe you are a &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; and have the
						ability to fix almost anything. You could propose an
						ongoing contract with a senior&#39;s apartment complex, for
						example, where you could be called upon for anything
						from changing light bulbs to doing plumbing repairs.<br />
						<br>
						You could use your web  development and SEO skills to provide them with a more usable and search visible company web site which gives them a stronger competitive edge. Or, if you have strong graphic design skills, you could offer to professionalize the look of all company marketing material - from their web site and email campaigns, to business cards,  stationary and the sign out front and on company vehicles.<br>
						<br />
						Perhaps you have strong writing skills and enjoy
						composing and organizing written materials.  You might offer to write and produce a monthly
						newsletter to assist an organization with its internal
						communications. Or you could suggest helping the
						marketing department with designing and writing
						marketing and promotional materials.
                        <br>
						<br>
                        <br />
						<strong>Writing A Winning Employment Proposal</strong> <br>
						Now that you have all the background information, it's time to write down your great ideas.
                        Remember, the purpose of an employment or work proposal is to sell yourself as a solution
                        to specific business problems or challenges. <br>
						<br>
						A proposal is best written after you have a clear
						understanding of the employer&#39;s situation and needs. You
						must also know exactly what you are going to propose,
						and make certain that it is a commitment you can live up
						to.<br>
						<br>
						Most importantly, be certain that the proposal clearly states
						the benefit to the prospective employer, so that when he
						or she asks &quot;So what&#39;s in it for me or for my company?&quot;,
						the answer is obvious.

			  <h2>3 Ways to Prove You&#39;re The One to Hire</h2>
					  <p class="addspace">What&#39;s the best way to get hired in this
						economy?</strong>
						Prove you&#39;re the best one for the position. <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">A great
						way to do this is to start working, even before you&#39;re
						hired</span>.<br>
						<br>
						Three mini-case studies that won
						jobs illustrate the importance of this job seeker&#39;s tactic.<br>
						<br>
						1) Start work BEFORE the interview<br>
						&quot;Six candidates were interviewing for a sales position
						in Atlanta with an exclusive company that had just
						received about $83 million in funding,&quot; says Ron
						Koon, a former recruiter and Executive VP of
						Staffers.com.<br>
						<br>
						&quot;Five candidates were &quot;top gun&quot; sales people who all
						came from industry leaders, and then there was Tony. He
						was young, with about five years of experience. But Tony
						was highly motivated and willing to go the extra mile.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						&quot;In his job interview, Tony not only mapped his
						accomplishments out on a PowerPoint presentation, he
						also demonstrated that he had already started working
						for the company. He did this by researching, assembling,
						and
						bringing with him a list of sales leads and contacts.
						His presentation consisted of the past, present AND future.
						The other candidates did nothing like this.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						Did it work?<br>
						<br>
						&quot;Tony was hired over five more experienced candidates,&quot;
						says Koon.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						2) Start work BEFORE the interview - Part 2<br>
						This example is near and dear to my heart - it&#39;s how I
						landed a job with a marketing communications firm back
						in the 1990s, when I worked for other people.<br>
						<br>
						After mailing in my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, I was called by a
						receptionist to schedule an interview. During our
						conversation, I asked if she could send me back issues
						of their corporate publications. I explained that I
						wanted to research the writing styles of the magazines
						and newsletters I would be editing if I got the job.<br>
						<br>
						She immediately agreed, and had a nice package of
						materials couriered to me the same day.<br>
						<br>
						It turned out to be a gold mine.<br>
						<br>
						I found three typos in one back issue of a magazine I
						would be proofreading in the position I was interviewing
						for. Here was proof I could do the job.<br>
						<br>
						Two days later at the interview, the subject of
						proofreading skills came up. I pulled out the magazine
						(with post-it notes marking the typos) and said: &quot;I&#39;ve
						been researching your publications and found these three
						errors. I can improve your image by preventing this kind
						of thing from happening again.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						They hired me.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						3) Start work AFTER the interview<br>
						This lesson in perseverance is a variation on the first
						story, about the candidate who brought a list of sales
						leads to his job interview.<br>
						<br>
						&quot;Robin, a woman from Los Angeles, had been interviewing
						with the same company for three months. She felt she was
						 perfect for the position, but the hiring manager was
						not responsive  -  he wouldn&#39;t tell her yes or no about a
						decision to hire her,&quot; says Ron Koon.<br>
						<br>
						So Robin called Koon to discuss her dilemma. His
						advice?<br>
						<br>
						&quot;I suggested that she REALLY demonstrate her skills to
						the hiring manager. I encouraged her to call 100
						potential customers and ask them, &#39;Would you be
						interested in looking at a technology that would solve
						your problem  and save you XX  dollars?&#39;&quot; says Koon.<br>
						<br>
						The next day, Robin walked into the manager&#39;s office,
						put her contact list on his desk and said, &quot;I&#39;ve already
						started working for you. In fact, I have 100 customers
						who are interested in your technology.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						What happened next?<br>
						<br>
						&quot;Robin was hired on the spot,&quot; says Koon.<br>
						<br>
                        <br>
						Your lesson: these three examples illustrate a common point.<br>
						<br>
						Do whatever you can to research your target company and
						&quot;start working&quot; for them before you&#39;re hired. It&#39;s one
						thing to claim you can do the job. It&#39;s quite another  -
						and much more powerful  -  to prove it.&nbsp;&nbsp;JobPro helps you research employers to understand their needs and how to meet them faster and better.

<h2>Cover Letters</h2>
<p class="addspace"><strong>10-Second Cover Letters</strong><br>

Attention spans are shorter today than ever before and you have just a few short moments to make an impact with
your cover letter and r&eacute;sum&eacute;. <br>
						<br>
						Since the cover letter is what most hiring managers and
						HR people read first, yours should make the most impact
						in the shortest time. <br>
						<br>
						You have less than 10 seconds in which to
						make your reader want to put down your cover letter,
						pick up the phone and call you for a job interview. <br>
						<br>
						Here are four ways to do just that. <br>
						<br>
						1. <strong>Limit yourself to five or six paragraphs</strong>. <br>
						The cover letters I write every day for clients are
						rarely longer than five paragraphs. That&#39;s an
						introductory paragraph, three bullet points to prove
						your skills and elicit curiosity, and a strong closing
						paragraph. <br>
						<br>
						A cover letter with this concise format is easy to scan
						and shows respect for the reader&#39;s limited time. If you
						need more room fine, but never exceed one page. <br>
						<br>
						2. <strong>Start smoothly</strong>. <br>
						Your first sentence is most important. Use it to give
						the reader context for the rest of your letter. For
						example, it can be very effective to simply say: &quot;I&#39;m
						applying for the position of Sales Rep, as advertised in
						the Wall St. Journal.&quot; <br>
						<br>
						If you heard about the opening from a friend, drop his
						name in that first sentence: &quot;Jack Smith suggested I
						contact you about the position of Design Engineer.&quot; <br>
						<br>
						3. <strong>Drop crumbs</strong>. <br>
						I like to include a &quot;teaser&quot; paragraph in every cover
						letter that says, more or less, &quot;Here&#39;s why you&#39;d be
						crazy not to call me.&quot; Try something like this: <br>
						<br>
						&quot;I&#39;ve developed methods, which I can share with you,
						that have produced a 15% gain in market share for my
						current employer over the past 11 months, producing $2.3
						million in new revenue.&quot; <br>
						<br>
						What&#39;s special about you? What can you do? Everyone is
						unique and valuable in some way. Make sure this comes
						through in your cover letter! <br>
						<br>
						When your cover letter opens with an attention-grabbing
						sentence, is error-free and tailored to the needs of the
						company that&#39;s hiring, you&#39;ll greatly increase the
						results you get in your job search! <br>
						<br>
						4. <strong>Finish strong</strong>. <br>
						Finish your cover letter with emphasis on how you can
						help your prospective employer. And, if possible,
						include a time when you&#39;ll call to discuss their needs.
						Here&#39;s an example closing paragraph: <br>
						<br>
						&quot;Now I would like to bring these skills to work for you.
						I look forward to speaking with you soon about the
						results you can expect from me, and will call your
						office next Tuesday to see if you would like to discuss
						this further.&quot;</p>
						<br>
						<br>
                        <br>

			  <h2>Your Cover Letter  -  So, What?</h2>
					  <p class="addspace">

						<strong>Does your cover letter grab readers by
						the lapels and leave them no choice but to call you for
						a job interview?</strong><br>
						<br>
						No?<br>
&nbsp;<strong><br>
					  </strong>Well, you&#39;re not alone. But you have work to do. <br>
						<br>
						Because, in this job market, every sentence in your
						cover letter must prove  -  in compelling detail  -  that
						you are the perfect person for the job. <br>
						<br>
						<strong>How do you do this? </strong> <br>
						<br>
						Take the &quot;So, what?&quot; test. It can actually force you to
						write better cover letters than ever before. And it&#39;s
						easier than you think. <br>
						<br>
						<strong>Read through your next cover letter and after every
						sentence ask yourself: &quot;So, what?&quot;</strong> Is that last sentence
						compelling, or fluff? Necessary? TRUE? If not, rewrite
						or remove it. Then ask yourself &quot;So, what?&quot; again.
						Revise until every sentence shines. <strong><br>
						</strong><br>
						Here are some &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; cover letter examples.<br>
						<br>
						BEFORE<br>
						&quot;I am currently employed with Kirchoff Systems in the
						Production Logistic Division as a Technical Support
						Manager. (SO, WHAT?) I am willing to take up any
						engineering post.&quot; (SO, WHAT?)<br>
						<br>
						AFTER<br>
						&quot;I am applying for a position where my eight years of
						engineering and end-user training experience will add
						value to logistical operations for your clients.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						In the AFTER example, the writer clearly states the type
						of job he seeks, while promising to make life easier for
						the employer&#39;s clients. This gives that employer an
						incentive to read on and learn more. <br>
						<br>
						BEFORE<br>
						&quot;The message you are now reading is not a typical cover
						letter with an attached r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Please, do not be afraid
						to continue reading because this evolving communiqu&eacute;
						describes what I can do for Aces Creations, if I am
						chosen as its new Marketing Manager.&quot; (SO WHAT?)<br>
						<br>
						Stop, stop, STOP!<br>
						<br>
						Don&#39;t take forever to warm up. You must quickly appeal
						to an employer&#39;s self interest. Often, you can find a
						good opening paragraph halfway down the page, as I did
						in this AFTER example:<br>
						<br>
						AFTER<br>
						&quot;I am energized by the opportunity to achieve
						significant things for your firm. Here&#39;s what I can give
						to Ace Novelty:<br>
						<br>
						* Five years of product development and marketing
						experience for Fortune 500 clients, resulting in repeat
						business, 210% revenue growth and three industry
						awards.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						This AFTER example came from the fifth and sixth
						paragraphs of the cover letter, but works much better as
						an opening. <br>
						<br>
						If every sentence passes the &quot;So, what?&quot; test, your
						cover letters will be concise, hard-hitting and
						irresistible to employers. Now, more than ever, that&#39;s a
						must!<br>

					  <h2>Tell Me About Yourself</h2>
					  <p class="addspace">One of the most dreaded job interview questions has to
						be &quot;So, tell me about yourself ...&quot;<br>
						<br>
						How in the heck do you prepare for an open-ended
						question like that? <strong><br>
						</strong><br>
						Your response to &quot;Tell me about yourself,&quot; will set the
						tone for the entire interview. You cannot afford to wing
						this answer!<br>
						<br>
						Here are five ways you can prepare.<br>
						<br>
						1) <strong>Focus</strong> <br>
						List five strengths you have that are pertinent to this
						job  -  experience, traits, skills, etc. What do you want
						the interviewer to remember about you most? <br>
						<br>
						2) <strong>Script</strong><br>
						Prepare a script that includes the information you want
						to convey. Talk about past experiences and proven
						success. Example: <br>
						<br>
						&quot;I have been in the customer service industry for five
						years. My most recent experience has been handling
						incoming calls in the high tech industry. One reason I
						really enjoy this business, and the challenges that go
						along with it, is the opportunity to connect with
						people. In my last job, I formed some significant
						customer relationships resulting in a 30
						percent increase in sales in 6 months.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						3) <strong>Mention your strengths and abilities</strong>:<br>
						&quot;My real strength is my attention to detail. I pride
						myself on my reputation for following through and
						meeting deadlines. When I commit to doing something, I
						make sure it gets done, and on time.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						4) <strong>Conclude with a statement about your current
						situation</strong>: <br>
						&quot;What I am looking for now is a company that values
						customer relations, where I can join a strong team and
						have a positive impact on customer retention and sales.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						5) <strong>Practice</strong> <br>
						Practice with your script until you feel confident about
						what you want to emphasize. Your script should help you
						stay on track, but you shouldn&#39;t memorize it  -  you
						don&#39;t want to sound stiff and rehearsed. It should sound
						natural and conversational. <br>
						<br>
						Even if you are not asked this type of question in an
						interview, this preparation will help you focus on what
						you have to offer. <br>
						<br>
						You will also find that you can use the information in
						this exercise to assist you in answering other
						questions. The more you can talk about your product  -
						you  -  the better chance you will have at selling it!

		<h2>Dancing with the Interviewer to Get the Job</h2>
		<p class="addspace">You need to dance with your interviewer to get the job. &quot;Let the
		interviewer lead. Your job is to follow with practiced intent.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		An interview, like a dance, brings two people together for a common
		purpose. And you both have to be fully engaged and know your respective
		roles for magic to happen.<br>
		<br>
		The music playing in the background of this dance is, &quot;Getting to know
		you, getting to know more about you.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Interviewers dance to learn about you and your suitability for the job,
		your skills, personality and attitude, your interest in the position,
		the organization.<br>
		<br>
		(Expect questions about your personal and work history, educational
		choices, salary history and current requirements. You&#39;ll also hear
		questions about your personal circumstances, sometimes in oblique ways.)
		<br>
		<br>
		You dance to learn more about the job and the employer and to discover
		whether this opportunity will help further your own career goals.<br>
		<br>
		(Prepare to ask questions like: What are the immediate and medium-term
		demands of the job? To whom does it report? What are her expectations?
		What is his management style? How does the position fit within the
		department? How does the department fit within the organization? Who are
		the organization&#39;s clients? What are its products, history, growth
		patterns, problems and potential?)<br>
		<br>
		Keep in mind, as you whirl around the conversational dance floor, that a
		third party is there, in the space between the two of you. That third
		party is the job, the position for which you are applying. In the best
		interviews, this job is the conduit through which all conversation
		flows.<br>
		<br>
		Here are some questions that come up time and again:<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Tell me about yourself.</strong> <br>
		Some job-seekers hate this question. It&#39;s too open-ended, too vague,
		they say. Still, it&#39;s often the opening gambit in many interviews.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		What the interviewer is really saying is, &quot;Tell me about yourself in
		relation to this job.&quot; The question provides an opportunity to begin
		your sales pitch.<br>
		<br>
		Tip: Keep your answer brief and targeted. Prepare a two-minute response
		about your work history, training, goals and personal interests. Before
		each interview, customize it to the position in question.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>What are your strengths? </strong> <br>
		Again, target your response to the needs of the job being discussed. If
		you note strengths that aren&#39;t relevant to the job, you miss an
		opportunity to address the employer&#39;s actual needs. If you know it&#39;s a
		high-pressure job and you&#39;ve got nerves of steel, say so. <br>
		<br>
		If the position needs a strong communicator, talk about your ability to
		express yourself and draw people out. Give examples from your past work,
		school or volunteer history.<br>
		<br>
		Tip: Answering this question directly isn&#39;t bragging, it&#39;s salesmanship.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>What are your weaknesses? </strong> <br>
		Some see this as a trick question; others say it&#39;s a stupid one. But it
		comes up often in interviews and requires a sincere response. <br>
		<br>
		Because most of the interview focuses on what you are and what you&#39;re
		capable of, this question is designed to provide some insight into what
		you aren&#39;t. Interviewers are looking for personal objectivity. <br>
		<br>
		Interviewers ask about weaknesses to see how objective you are about
		yourself and your own limitations, to see if you recognize your flaws
		and use initiative to overcome them. <br>
		<br>
		With planning you can answer this question without fear of
		repercussions. You will have to acknowledge your weaknesses, but we all
		have them, even the interviewers asking about yours. <br>
		<br>
		Take your nature, abilities and circumstances into account and list a
		few weaknesses or limitations. Before an interview, review the
		requirements of the job against this list and identify a shortcoming
		that you feel comfortable discussing. <br>
		<br>
		You might look for a weakness that doesn&#39;t disqualify you for the job.
		(&quot;Chocolate,&quot; a woman once responded when asked for her greatest
		weakness.) <br>
		<br>
		You could also discuss a shortcoming that you&#39;re working to overcome.
		(&quot;My biggest weakness is that English is my second language. But I&#39;m
		enrolled in classes and studying hard and my language skills improve
		with each passing day.&quot;) <br>
		<br>
		Then again, you could discuss a weakness that is also a strength. (&quot;I am
		very determined to complete whatever I start and sometimes I can become
		stubborn. But I&#39;m aware of the fine line between the two and take care
		not to cross it.&quot;)<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Why did you leave your last employer?</strong><br>
		If you left your last job seeking greater challenge and responsibility
		and on good terms, you will probably have little trouble with this
		question. But if you were let go, or nudged out in some way, this could
		be a touchy issue. <br>
		<br>
		Work diligently to develop a philosophical view of the circumstances.
		Something like: &quot;Leaving wasn&#39;t my idea, but it became necessary because
		. . . . Still, I learned a great deal in that job. Now, I&#39;m very keen to
		apply that knowledge to another position, like this one, that better
		suits my abilities.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Tip: Never bad-mouth a previous employer, no matter how sympathetic the
		interviewer may seem.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Why should we hire you? <br>
		</strong>This question is generally asked toward the end of the interview and may
		be worded in softer language, such as: &quot;Are you interested in this job?&quot;
		<br>
		<br>
		It gives you an opening to indicate your strong interest in the position
		and the organization. Here&#39;s you can summarize what you&#39;ve learned about
		the position and re-emphasize your skills, abilities and experience as
		they relate to this position. <br>
		<br>
		Tip: This is often your final chance to sell yourself. <br>
		<br>
		At the end of every interview, critique your skills (and your dancing
		partner&#39;s, as well).<br>
		<br>
		Did you both learn what you need to know? Did you answer questions fully
		and yet succinctly? Did you ask questions intelligently? Did you keep
		the job you applied for top of mind? Would you like to work for this
		organization? Did you convince your interviewer that you were a suitable
		candidate? <br>
		<br>
		Ongoing assessment of this kind can help build your interview skills.
		Like dancing skills, they improve with practice.

					  <br>
					  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
					  <h2>Does &quot;No Calls&quot; Mean No Calls?</h2>
					  <p class="addspace">
						You&#39;ve seen want ads that end with &quot;<strong>No calls please,</strong>&quot;
						but you REALLY want that job and you know it makes good sense to follow up after sending
                        your r&eacute;sum&eacute; to employers.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Should you pick up the phone?</strong>
						<br>
						<br>
						If you call the HR department simply to ask if they
						got your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, that won&#39;t help your case. <br>
						<br>
						One HR manager in Minneapolis, Steve, says: &quot;If you call
						to ask about the r&eacute;sum&eacute; you&#39;ve sent, it puts me in an
						awkward position, because I probably won&#39;t recognize
						you. I simply read too many r&eacute;sum&eacute;s to remember them
						all.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						With that in mind, it can be productive to avoid HR and
						other gatekeepers by instead calling the manager you&#39;d
						actually work for. Especially if the job requires
						persistence and determination, a well placed phone call
						can help. But do it right!<br>
						<br>
						&quot;<strong>Cold calling me out of the blue won&#39;t improve your
						chances</strong>,&quot; says Terry, an insurance company manager based in
						Vancouver, BC.
                        &quot;<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">However, if a candidate has made contact
						with me before or comes referred from someone I know, then I don&#39;t mind a call.
                        If I see a good match, I can pass their name on to HR with a recommendation.</span>&quot;<br>
						<br>
						Moral? Dig your well before you&#39;re thirsty!



						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Start
						expanding your network of contacts at potential
						employers NOW, so you can make more phone calls later to
						decision makers who know you</span>.<br>
						<br>
						Think of it like this: everybody at every company knows
						somebody. Call or write everybody in your network now
						and ask: &quot;Do you know anyone - personally or
						professionally  -  who works at ABC Company?&quot; Eventually,
						you&#39;ll make a connection. Then make the call.<br>
						<br>
						Meanwhile,







						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">if you REALLY want to call about a job
						posting that says, &quot;No calls,&quot; make sure you bypass HR and talk to a decision maker directly</span>. You can sometimes  get their names, phone numbers and job tiles from the company web site or a  business directory, or by phoning the main office. <br>
						<br>







						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">When you call, be brief, professional and informed.</span>
						Offer to email or fax your r&eacute;sum&eacute; for review and give
						reasons why you&#39;d be valuable to the hiring manager.
						Then,







						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">send a short note to thank them for their time.</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>

			  <h2>A Job Created Just for You</h2>
					  <p class="addspace">In good times and bad, there are jobs to be had.<br>
						<br>
						But if you follow the crowds and apply only for
						positions advertised in the classifieds or on Internet
						job sites, you&#39;re doing what everybody else is doing.<br>
						<br>
						And just about everybody is finding this job market
						tougher than a $3.00 steak.<br>
						<br>
						There&#39;s another way.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>You can effectively create your own private job market
					    -  and have jobs created just for you</strong>  -  if you do one
						simple thing:

						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">&nbsp;&nbsp;Send an &quot;employment proposal&quot;  to employers and ask to meet with them</span>.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Here&#39;s how you can write a simple letter to employers  -
						and get job offers.</strong><br>
						<br>
						1) What&#39;s the process? How&#39;s it done?<br>
						In a nutshell, you write a concise &quot;approach letter&quot;
						to the person you want to work for, sell them on your
						skills, and ask to meet.<br>
						<br>
						Jobs get created on the spot for people who make a
						strong case for hiring them.<br>
						<br>
						One of the biggest problems in running any company is
						getting the right people, so a good leader is often
						looking for new star employees. <br>
						<br>
						Since star employees are usually action-oriented, the
						act of writing a letter to ask for a meeting shows
						initiative. Which can earmark you as the kind of
						go-getter that employers want on their team.<br>
						<br>
						2) What do you say in your letter?<br>
						Surprise! You&#39;re not sending a r&eacute;sum&eacute; or cover letter.<br>
						<br>
						Instead, write a concise employment proposal to the appropriate decision maker of the division or company you want to work
						for. Your aim? To sell them on the idea of meeting you.<br>
						<br>
						Letters should say, in effect, &quot;Here&#39;s what attracts me
						to your organization,  here are the skills and
						abilities I can contribute, and what I've done to make money/save money and find solutions to problems similar or identical to those facing your organization. Would you be open to
						discussing this?&quot;<br>
						<br>
						To write an effective employment proposal, research and
						learn the needs of your target company. You can talk to
						people who work there or at the competition. And your
						experience can provide valuable insights, too, if you&#39;re
						in the same industry.<br>
						<br>
						Be sure to hand-deliver or mail an actual paper proposal. Since it&#39;s
						tangible, it can&#39;t be deleted in two seconds, like an
						email.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						3) How well can this work?<br>
						<br>
						You may or may not experience a high number of calls for
						interviews, but if the phone isn&#39;t ringing now, what
						have you got to lose?<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						4) Can this work in a slow job market?<br>
						What about the current economic doldrums? Are employers
						hiring?<br>
						<br>
						The need for good employees is even greater when times
						are tough.<br>
						<br>
						With more job hunters chasing a shrinking number of
						advertised positions, you should have less competition
						by approaching employers directly. So, a rotten job
						market may actually favor you.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						5) Final analysis<br>
						While some may dismiss this &quot;approach letter&quot; tactic as
						too simple or not right for their industry, it&#39;s
						important to remember this: you&#39;ll never be hired for
						any job without meeting with someone first. Why not
						initiate that meeting on your own terms?<br>
						<br>
						It&#39;s amazing how many people treat the job search as a
						non-human process, when, in fact, the decision-making is
						all done by humans.<br>
						<br>

              <h2>Answering Questions of Salary</h2>
		              <p class="addspace">You want a higher salary in your next job, right?<br>
						Yet, you&#39;re worried about discussing salary, right? <br>
						<br>
						If you&#39;re like most people, you answered, &quot;yes&quot; to both
						questions.<br>
						<br>
						Let&#39;s face it, discussing salary is a touchy subject in
						any job interview -  what if you ask for too much or not
						enough? <br>
						<br>
						Here&#39;s how you can navigate the salary question and
						position yourself to make more money, before and during
						the job interview.<br>
						<br>
						First, when replying to classified ads that ask for
						salary requirements or a salary history, I advise you
						NOT to answer directly. Because, in my view, any answer
						will hurt your chances.<br>
						<br>
						Remember that a typical classified ad can produce
						hundreds of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. And a fast way to make that pile
						smaller is to weed out applicants who are either too
						expensive (over-qualified) or too cheap
						(under-qualified). <br>
						<br>
						So, in your cover letter, I would simply say: &quot;My salary
						requirements are negotiable.&quot; This shows you&#39;ve read the
						ad, but are choosing to dodge the issue. Most HR
						professionals and hiring managers I&#39;ve talked to won&#39;t
						take offense. On the contrary, it gives them one LESS
						reason NOT to call you.<br>
						<br>
						What about salary questions in the interview? These
						require advance planning.<br>
						<br>
						You can say: &quot;Well, I&#39;d like to make as much as other
						employees with my qualifications.&quot; (Here you can repeat
						2-3 of your most valuable skills or achievements, just
						to remind them how qualified you are.) Then add: &quot;And
						what is a typical salary for this position?&quot; <br>
						<br>
						Another strategy is to avoid a specific salary ... and
						name a pay range instead. Say: &quot;I was thinking of a
						salary in the $30,000 to $45,000 range,&quot; (with $30,000
						being the lowest amount you&#39;d accept). That way, you can
						name a higher figure, if they try to pin you down, yet
						still be able to retreat to a point that satisfies you.<br>
						<br>
						Finally, information is power here. If you can back your
						salary request with a list of average salaries you&#39;ve
						obtained from the Internet or from phone calls, you&#39;ll
						enjoy greater leverage in your negotiations.<br>
						<br>

		              <h2>Layoff Worries? Here Are 5 Things You Can Do Today</h2>
		              <p class="addspace">In this economy, you hear more and more about layoffs.
						What if your job is axed? What can you do to find a new
						one as quickly and painlessly as possible?<br>
						<br>
						Here are five suggestions.<br>
						<br>
						1) <strong>Tighten your financial belt</strong>. <br>
						If you&#39;re laid off now or about to be, cut back on your
						expenses by at least 15-25%. <br>
						<br>
						Reason? You don&#39;t want to feel pressured to take the
						first job that comes along if your savings dry up after
						10 days. Because the only thing worse than having no job
						is having the wrong job.<br>
						<br>
						2) <strong>Recognize that you have value</strong>. <br>
						Avoid the mindset of many job seekers, who think: &quot;Why
						won&#39;t someone give me a job?&quot; Instead, think: &quot;Other
						companies need the solutions I provided for my last
						employer. I&#39;m now wiser and better. Which employers are
						worth
						my time?&quot; <br>
						<br>
						This paradigm shift will produce a tremendous amount of
						self-confidence within you. And, all things being equal,
						employers are more likely to hire a confident candidate
						than a desperate one who&#39;s practically begging for a
						job. Try it and see!<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						3) <strong>Recognize the value of your personal and professional
						network. </strong>
						<br>
						Remember: networking is how most jobs are filled. Sure,
						the Internet is an easy way to apply for 248 openings in
						10 minutes, but you&#39;ll have FAR LESS competition if you
						apply for a handful of jobs through people you know.
						Never forget this!<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						4) <strong>Write a r&eacute;sum&eacute; that&#39;s heavy on achievements. </strong>
						<br>
						I recommend a mix of 80% specific achievements and 20%
						duties. This will immediately set you apart from most
						job seekers, who do the opposite. <br>
						<br>
						<br>
						5) <strong>Realize that your job search is a job in itself.</strong><br>
						It requires nothing less than 40 or more hours a week,
						every week. Don&#39;t fall for the &quot;e-fallacy&quot; of posting
						your r&eacute;sum&eacute; to 10 Web sites, applying by email to 7 job
						postings ... and then calling it a day.<br>
						<br>
						You must commit to getting on the phone with decision
						makers who can hire you. Start with your network and go
						from there, always asking for referrals along the way.
						Set hourly, daily and weekly goals for networking calls,
						in-person visits and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s sent out. Then, get going!<br>
						<br>
						<br>
					  </p>
		              <h2>Are You Prepared to Succeed?</h2>
		              <p class="addspace">Finding a job can be like painting your bathroom. If you
						prepare thoroughly, the actual task will go smoothly.
						But if you fail to prepare, you could be preparing to
						fail.<br>
						<br>
						Here are three ways you can prepare  -  and succeed  -  in
						your next job search ... in any economy.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						1) <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <strong><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Prepare a results-driven r&eacute;sum&eacute;</span></strong><br>
						Write a r&eacute;sum&eacute; that&#39;s focused on a particular job or
						industry, outlines your most marketable skills, and
						proves you have those skills by including plenty of
						specific achievements.<br>
						<br>
						Remember, <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">every employer reading your r&eacute;sum&eacute; wants an
						answer to this question</span>: &quot;<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">What&#39;s in it for me?</span>&quot; If your
						r&eacute;sum&eacute; is all about you and your needs, revise it until
						focuses on the employer&#39;s problems and how you can solve
						them.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						2) <strong>Prepare your network</strong><br>
						The most valuable (and overlooked) weapon in your job
						search arsenal is your network. Everyone you know
						personally and professionally can be a source of job
						leads. But you have to tell them EXACTLY what you&#39;re
						looking for, or they won&#39;t be able to help.<br>
						<br>
						Don&#39;t ask people: &quot;Do you know where I can find a job?&quot;
						Instead, ask: &quot;Who do you know who needs a graphic
						designer, with five years of award-winning experience
						creating marketing collateral for Fortune 1000 clients?&quot;
						<br>
						<br>
						See the difference? If you paint a clear picture of what
						you want and what you can offer, you&#39;ll get it faster.<br>
						<br>
						Also, be sure to expand your network by asking everyone
						you know this magic question: &quot;Do you know anyone else I
						should be talking to?&quot; Try it! <br>
						<br>
						<br>
						3) <strong>Prepare your interview skills</strong><br>
						Your first interview should never be for your ideal job
						 -  too much can go wrong. Make your mistakes early by
						interviewing with less-desirable companies (or your
						reflection in a mirror!) until your answers are polished
						and smooth. <br>
						<br>
						Don&#39;t be like the computer programmer I know whose first
						interview out of college was with the employer of her
						dreams. She made several rookie mistakes ... and was not
						called back.<br>
						<br>
						The more prepared you are with an updated r&eacute;sum&eacute;,
						expanding network and sharp interview skills, the more
						opportunities you will uncover. And the shorter your job
						search will be.<br>
						<br>

              <h2>How to Write Letters of Resignation and Acceptance</h2>
		              <p class="addspace">First and last impressions are important in your career.
						And you never get a second chance to make either!<br>
						<br>
						If you resign gracefully from your current job, it can
						smooth the transition to your next one. Why burn
						bridges? If you leave on positive terms, you can
						maintain a network of ex-coworkers and managers to call
						on later for help at your next company. <br>
						<br>
						Likewise, a well-written acceptance letter can help set
						a positive tone for your first day on the new job. <br>
						<br>
						First, let&#39;s say goodbye. <br>
						<br>
						In your resignation letter, emphasize the best parts of
						your employment. Include one or two achievements you
						were especially proud of. This will reinforce the value
						you created and help create a lasting, positive
						impression of you. <br>
						<br>
						Language like this may help get you started quitting:<br>
						<br>
						&quot;Dear Steve,<br>
						<br>
						This will confirm that I will leave ABC Company on
						October 1, 2010 to accept a position at XYZ Inc. It&#39;s
						been a pleasure working with you on such projects as the
						Widget Deluxe roll-out and the Web site upgrade. I will
						be more than happy to assist you and my replacement in
						making this transition over the next two weeks and
						thereafter, so please feel free to contact me at XYZ
						should you have any questions.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						Writing your acceptance letter can often be easier ...
						and more fun.<br>
						<br>
						Here, your task is to reinforce the skills or expertise
						that made your employer want to hire you in the first
						place. You might follow this format:<br>
						<br>
						&quot;Dear Cindy,<br>
						<br>
						I&#39;m delighted to accept your offer for the position of
						Assistant Manager. I look forward to starting on the
						programs you and I discussed in our last interview,
						particularly your online marketing initiative, which
						will allow me to use the professional contacts and
						research skills I&#39;ve developed over the last four years.
						I look forward to seeing you Monday morning, July 1.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						The exact words aren&#39;t important. Just try to stay
						upbeat and positive in your letters. Do this and you&#39;ll
						enjoy a smooth transition from one successful job to the
						next, and the next, and the next ...<br>
						<br>
						<br>
					  </p>
		              <h2>Your Elevator Speech: Answering &quot;Why should I hire	you?&quot;</h2>
		              <p class="addspace">That&#39;s about the shortest  -  and toughest  -  question
						you might ever be asked in a job interview. <br>
						<br>
						So ... what&#39;s your answer? Why should an employer hire
						you instead of someone else with similar skills and
						experience?<br>
						<br>
						The more convincing your answer, the shorter your next
						job search is likely to be.<br>
						<br>
						Here&#39;s a trick that will force you to develop a short,
						convincing 30-second commercial for yourself. It&#39;s
						called the Elevator Speech; your &quot;unique selling
						proposition.&quot; <br>
						<br>
						Here&#39;s the scenario. <br>
						<br>
						On the way to a job interview with ABC Company, you step
						on the elevator with ABC&#39;s owner. You introduce yourself
						and she recognizes you, asking: &quot;Why should I hire you?&quot;
						You have until the elevator reaches her floor to
						convince her. Try to answer in 30 seconds or less (about
						150 words).<br>
						<br>
						Avoid trite claims that anyone could make, such as: &quot;I&#39;m
						honest, hard-working and trustworthy.&quot; This makes you
						sound like a Boy Scout. <br>
						<br>
						Instead, focus on YOUR unique combination of specific
						skills, knowledge and experience. Ideally, they&#39;ll all
						have something to do with the job you&#39;re after.<br>
						<br>
						Example Elevator Speech: &quot;During my five years of
						helpdesk experience, I&#39;ve encountered and solved just
						about every problem imaginable, supporting more than 225
						users on the same operating system your company uses -
						Windows XP. I also saved $23,000 by using pre-owned
						hardware for our latest upgrade. Before that, I
						completed officer&#39;s training as an ROTC student while
						earning my MIS degree. This gives me a broader range of
						technical, leadership and problem-solving skills than
						typical applicants.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						According to marketing expert Larry Chase, (and what is
						a job search, after all, but a marketing campaign?): &quot;I
						find people appreciate it when you respond in less time
						than they anticipated. It telegraphs that you are
						clearly focused and waste no time getting to the point&quot;.<br>
						<br>
						So, get to the point in your next job interview. In 30
						seconds, if you can. And you can if you develop a short,
						sharp elevator speech. <br>
						<br>
						<br>

              <h2>Be Specific in Your Cover Letter</h2>
              <strong>Cover Letter Success is All About Specifics</strong>

		<p class="addspace">by Katharine Hansen <br>
		<br>
		You&#39;ve heard the adage in real estate and retailing that success centers
		on three things: location, location, location. With cover letters,
		success is also tied to three things: specifics, specifics, specifics.
		<br>
		<br>
		In our roles as r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter writers, we often get requests
		from customers that go something like this: &quot;Just give me a general
		cover letter that I can use for any kind of job.&quot; Sorry. No can do.
		Well, we can do it, but we certainly don&#39;t recommend it. <br>
		<br>
		A cover letter needs to be specific in every way. Otherwise, it&#39;s a
		fairly pointless document. Some experts say even a r&eacute;sum&eacute; should be
		specifically tailored for each job. While we feel that a degree of
		r&eacute;sum&eacute; tailoring is sometimes desirable, extensive tailoring is
		unnecessary if you&#39;re specific with your cover letter. <br>
		<br>
		Among the many ways you should make each cover letter quite specific
		are: <br>
		<br>
		Specific Recipient: A cover letter must be addressed to the specific
		name of the recipient. It&#39;s not always easy to find the name of the
		specific hiring manager, but try to do so if at all possible. Usually,
		you can just call the company and ask who the hiring manager is for a
		given position. The worst-case scenario is that your letter will begin
		&quot;Dear Hiring Manager for [name of position]:&quot; Your letter should not
		begin: &quot;Dear Sir or Madam&quot; or, worst of all, &quot;To Whom It May Concern.&quot;
		That lazy approach shows the employer that you were not concerned enough
		to find out whom your letter does concern. <br>
		<br>
		Specific Position: An effective cover letter must target a specific
		position, which should be mentioned in the first paragraph. If you&#39;re
		answering an ad, it&#39;s easy to target your letter to a specific job. But
		if you&#39;re making cold contacts to employers, you&#39;ll have to do some
		research to find out what positions that the company offers fit your
		qualifications. Don&#39;t list several possible positions or say that you&#39;re
		willing to consider any position. If you do, the employer will see you
		as unfocused or even desperate. <br>
		<br>
		Specific Skills/Qualifications: It&#39;s perfectly okay if some parts of
		your letter are the same from cover letter to cover letter. But you need
		to be very specific when describing your skills and qualifications.
		Determine the skills and experiences that specifically qualify you for
		the job you&#39;re applying for, and describe those in your letter.
		Following are example paragraphs from a photographer looking to
		transition into a sales career. Both letters are for account-executive
		positions, but the letter writer stresses slightly different skills in
		each letter based on the qualifications listed in the ads to which she
		is responding: <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Example 1:</strong><br>
		The exceptional organizational abilities and detail orientation I
		deployed to set up photo shoots are directly applicable to the skills
		needed to plan and coordinate events. With great profitability, I can
		prospect new business opportunities, strategize communication
		initiatives, successfully manage client relationships, give
		presentations, and much more. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
		My experience in the client-service end of the photography business has
		ingrained in me the importance of establishing solid relationships built
		on excellent service. With great profitability, I can prospect new
		accounts, provide the required excellent level of service, successfully
		build an account base, close deals, retain customers, and much more. <br>
		<br>
		Specific Examples: Whenever possible, don&#39;t just offer unsubstantiated
		value judgments about yourself; use concrete examples to demonstrate
		your claims about yourself. Example: <br>
		<br>
		I demonstrated my strategic ability when I successfully developed a
		direct corporate sales program and a corporate affinity program for
		ToyVillage.com. <br>
		Specific company knowledge: Demonstrating knowledge of the employer to
		which you are writing is not a mandatory part of a cover letter, but
		it&#39;s a great touch that will often win favor in the eye of the employer.
		On one level, you can write something that sounds specific to the
		company you&#39;re writing to but that really can be said to any employer:
		<br>
		<br>
		I am intensely interested in contributing my skills and experience to
		your firm because of your company&#39;s reputation for quality. <br>
		On a higher level, however, you can do your homework and write something
		that truly is specific to the company you&#39;re writing to: <br>
		<br>
	Over the last two years I have followed the unfolding events at Guffman
		Enterprises with great interest as the firm moved into financial and
		broadband services. <br>
		<br>
		Specific tailoring to a want ad: If you&#39;re answering an ad, the

		specifics of your cover letter should be tied as closely as possible to
		the actual wording of the ad you&#39;re responding to. I&#39;ve had students
		express concern that it&#39;s plagiarism to use the words of an ad in one&#39;s
		cover letter, but here&#39;s a case where using someone else&#39;s words is a
		plus rather than a minus. <br>
		<br>
		In his book, <i>Don&#39;t Send a r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i>, Jeffrey Fox calls the best
		letters written in response to want ads &quot;Boomerang letters&quot; because they
		&quot;fly the want ad words  -  the copy  -  back to the writer of the ad.&quot; In
		employing what Fox calls &quot;a compelling sales technique,&quot; he advises
		letter writers to: &quot;Flatter the person who wrote the ad with your
		response letter. Echo the author&#39;s words and intent. Your letter should
		be a mirror of the ad.&quot; Fox notes that when the recipient reads such a
		letter, the thought process will be: &quot;This person seems to fit the
		description. This person gets it.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		A particularly effective way to deploy the specifics of a want ad to
		your advantage is to use a two-column format in which you quote in the
		left-hand column specific qualifications that come right from the
		employer&#39;s want ad and in the right-hand column, your attributes that
		meet those qualifications. <br>
		<br>
		The two-column format is extremely effective when you possess all the
		qualifications for a job, but it can even sell you when you are lacking
		one or more qualification. The format so clearly demonstrates that you
		are qualified in so many areas that the employer may be willing to
		overlook the areas in which you lack the exact qualifications. See a
		sample letter in a two-column format. <br>
		<br>
		Specific benefit to employer: Jeffrey Gunhus writes in his new book, No
		Parachute Required, &quot;The purpose of a cover letter is to explain how you
		(the candidate) will benefit me (the company).&quot; Your letter should
		should tell very specifically how you will meet the employer&#39;s needs,
		solve the employer&#39;s problems, or otherwise benefit the hiring company.
		For example: <br>
		<br>
		When I interviewed Ms. Kirkwood six months ago to obtain information
		about a career in real estate, she mentioned that the agency would like
		to establish a Web presence. I&#39;d like to combine my interest in real
		estate with my knowledge of Web page design and HTML programming to help
		you create a Webmaster position in your office. I&#39;ve even sketched out
		some preliminary ideas on what your Web page might look like, and I&#39;d
		love to get together and show them to you. <br>
		<br>
		Specific request for action and specific description of your planned
		follow-up action: Don&#39;t be vague about your desire to be interviewed.
		Come right out and ask for an interview. Then, take your specific action
		a step farther and tell the recipient that you will contact him or her
		in a specified period of time to arrange an interview appointment. <br>
		<br>
		Obviously, if you say you will follow up, you have to do so. If you take
		this proactive approach and follow up, you will be much more likely to
		get interviews than if you did not follow up. This follow-up aspect is
		another good reason to obtain the specific name of the hiring manager.
		Here&#39;s a sample closing paragraph requesting specific action and
		describing the writer&#39;s planned follow-up. <br>
		<br>
		I would like to be considered for a sales position in which someone of
		my background could make a contribution. I will contact you soon to
		arrange for an interview. Should you require any additional information,
		I can be contacted at the phone numbers listed above.

<h2>
<br>
Gaining a Competitive Edge and Standing Out From Your Competition: Two Instructive Case Studies</h2>
<p class="addspace">Here&#39;s helpful information you can use today in your job search ... below are two case studies with takeaway tips you can use immediately.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Case Study #1  -  Talk to the Hiring Manager</strong> <br>
<br>
Eugene, a developer, saw a posting online for a job he really wanted. He first thought he would e-mail his
r&eacute;sum&eacute; and wait.
						<br>
						<br>
But that approach hadn&#39;t produced any callbacks for three months, so he decided to try something different. Eugene picked up the phone, got the phone number of the contact person listed in the job posting from the company switchboard, and called her.

He asked if he could hand-deliver his r&eacute;sum&eacute;. She told him no, but he struck up a conversation and learned enough about the position to write a targeted cover letter, which he e-mailed with his r&eacute;sum&eacute;.
						  <br>
						<br>
After that, Eugene made three follow-up calls, one week apart, to politely ask if a decision had been made. Since he had already built a rapport with the hiring manager during his first call, she didn&#39;t see this as an intrusion.

Between his second and third follow-up calls, <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Eugene employed a tactic that set him apart from every other candidate: He offered to deliver a portfolio of additional material.</span>
						The hiring manager agreed.

						<br>
						<br>
						So Eugene put together a collection of awards and descriptions of projects he had worked on. As he was dropping off this "brag book" with the receptionist, he met several employees in the lobby.
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">He asked about the four biggest problems they were facing on the job, took notes, and then went home to think up solutions.</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Finally, after four weeks, three follow-up phone calls, and one hand-delivered portfolio, Eugene was called for an interview.</strong> He aced it, as well as the interview that followed, and got the job.

After talking to employees and researching the company&#39;s products and customers on its
						web site, he was able to talk intelligently and make helpful suggestions, and he impressed the interviewers.

						<br>
						<br>
											  Your Takeaway  -  Persistence and creativity will set you apart from the hordes of passive job seekers. Find out who the decision maker is, then email or call that person every 7-10 days to follow up. Politely ask if a hiring decision has been made AND try to offer additional information or insights about the job you seek.

In Eugene&#39;s case, he offered to hand-deliver a portfolio of material to further prove he was the right person for the job. What extra material, competitive research, or work samples could you provide? No matter how you cut it, if a job is worth having, it&#39;s worth following up on.
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Case Study #2  -  Focus on Results						</strong>					  </p>
					  <p class="addspace">Frank, a network administrator,
						<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">had
						an interview in the midst of a raging
						recession, and was offered a position advertised on Monster.com</span>

						Frank&#39;s r&eacute;sum&eacute; stuck out  -  he was one of only two
					  applicants interviewed.</p>
					  <p class="addspace">
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">He had no experience on any of the

					  over his current salary.</span></p>
					  <p class="MsoNormal">These are <strong>sample bullet points from
					  Frank&#39;s r&eacute;sum&eacute;</strong>:</p>
					  <ul type="disc">
						  <li class="MsoNormal">
							<p class="addspace">More than 10 years of
							hardware/software experience includes programming,
							configuration, troubleshooting, and support. Strong
							in Oracle, Access, SQL Server, and wireless
						  networks.</li>
						  <li class="MsoNormal">
							<p class="addspace">Helped retain $20 million

						  <li class="MsoNormal">
							<p class="addspace">Retained during a 75 percent

					  </ul>
					  <p class="addspace">Your Takeaway  -
						<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Write a r&eacute;sum&eacute;
						that focuses on specific results rather than dry lists
						of duties and responsibilities</span>. This will make the phone
						ring with job offers. To force yourself to focus on
						results, <strong>tack this phrase onto the end of the duties in
					  your r&eacute;sum&eacute;</strong> - &quot;<strong>As a result.</strong>&quot; &nbsp;</p>
					  <font size="2">
					  <p class="addspace">When you do that, you can transform
					  a section like this:</p>
					  <ul type="disc">
						  <li class="MsoNormal">
							<p class="addspace">Maintained data backup and
							restoration. Interfaced with programmers to test and
							build monitoring applications. Wrote documentation

					  </ul>
					  <p class="addspace">... into one like this, which gets
						you noticed:
	          <ul>
						  <li>
							<p class="addspace">Streamlined data backup and
							restoration procedures. Worked with programmers to
							test and build monitoring application. Wrote
							documentation and training guidelines. <strong>As a result,</strong>
							cut monitoring times by 25%, while reducing average
							support calls from over 10 per month to one (90%
						drop).						</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p class="addspace"><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">To stand out from a stack of cover letters, yours must
						focus less on you and more on the results you can
						deliver. </span>  <br>
						<br>
						If you do nothing else, <strong>try replacing the words &quot;I&quot;,
						&quot;me&quot; and &quot;my&quot; with &quot;you&quot; wherever possible</strong>. This will
						put the emphasis back where it belongs  -  on the
						employer and his/her problems. <br>
						<br>
						Here&#39;s a before-and-after example of an actual cover
						letter. Note the number of times &quot;I&quot; and &quot;my&quot; appear:
						<br>
						<br>
						&quot;I am enclosing my r&eacute;sum&eacute; for your review because I am
						very interested in obtaining a full-time position as an
						Investment Banking Analyst at Ace Financial. <br>
						<br>
						&quot;I am well qualified for this position. In addition to
						the strong quantitative and analytical skills I have
						developed as an undergraduate economics major and in my
						work experience, I have a proven ability to stay focused
						for long hours under pressure.&quot; <br>
						<br>
						There are five instances of &quot;I&quot; and two of &quot;my.&quot; <br>
						<br>
						Now, here&#39;s that same cover letter, revised to focus
						more on the reader: <br>
						<br>
						&quot;I am applying for the position of Investment Banking
						Analyst where my combination of economics training and
						high-tech experience will add value to your operations.
						Please consider the following: <br>
						<br>
						&quot;You will gain from my strong financial background,
						which includes a recent bachelor&#39;s degree in economics,
						coupled with experience researching and trading
						securities as a successful investor (resulting in
						returns of 200%).&quot; <br>
						<br>
						Just one &quot;I&quot; and two &quot;mys&quot;  -  a 57% reduction. With
						&quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; thrown in twice for good measure. <br>
						<br>
				Replacing &quot;I&quot; with &quot;you&quot; is an old advertising trick
						that&#39;s worked for decades. (Read any good advertisement
						and you&#39;ll always find &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; sprinkled
						liberally throughout.) And what&#39;s your cover letter?
						Essentially, it&#39;s an advertisement for your
			  r&eacute;sum&eacute;...which is an advertisement for you.<br />

                      <h2>Join a Job Hunting Support Group, or Create One of
                      Your Own</h2>
                      <p class="addspace">Members of these groups provide moral
                        support and assistance to each other as well an
                        extension of that critical personal network. Need a
                        contact inside a specific company? Ask the members of
                        your group if they know anyone there. Need another set
                        of eyes to look at your r&eacute;sum&eacute;? Ask the members of your
                        group for help. Of course, you can also demonstrate your
                        intelligence, professionalism, ethics, experience, etc.
                        by helping members of the group in return.<br>
                        <br>
                        It probably goes without saying, but don&#39;t be a &quot;user.&quot;
                        Look for ways you can help other members, and the help
                        will come back to you. Support groups can be a win/win
                        situation, and, sometimes, the critical link between you
                        and the perfect job in the Hidden Job Market.

                        <strong>Warning<br>
						<br>
					    </strong>Don&#39;t spend all your job search time
                        with your job search support group! Sometimes they can
                        become an unproductive pity party. Have agendas, action
                        items, and a focus on positive action to find a job.<br>

                        <strong><br>
						Teach a class</strong>
						<br>
						<br>
						If there is community-based adult
                        education provided somewhere in your area, see if you
                        can teach something for them. Get a copy of their course
                        catalog, and see what they are offering. Is there a
                        subject you could teach that they don&#39;t offer but might
                        want to offer? You may be able to offer a one- or
                        two-session &quot;workshop&quot; or &quot;seminar&quot; if you have a topic
                        that is interesting. Just be sure that it is a topic you
                        know very well and one that demonstrates your knowledge
                        and professionalism. <br>
                        <br>
                        A local college or university may need an &quot;adjunct&quot;
                        instructor for specific subjects, and may be open to
                        someone &quot;outside&quot; the faculty providing the instruction.
                        Don&#39;t expect to support yourself and your family on the
                        money made from teaching these classes, but do expect to
                        be paid something for your time and effort. <br>
                        <br>
                        Focus on teaching a subject that demonstrates your
                        professional knowledge and skill, and presents you in
                        the best light as a valuable addition to a potential

						Tips</strong> <br>
                        <br>
                        Get and keep copies of the course catalog with your
                        course and, hopefully, your name in it.
                        Let class members know that you are &quot;between
                        assignments&quot; and interested in finding a new job.<br>
						<br>
                        Collect feedback from class members so that you can
                        improve your material and presentation, and get some
                        contact names (use with permission only!)<br>
                        Add the class to the accomplishments on your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong><br>
												Write an article =&gt; you become
						an author =&gt; you become an authority! </strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Not comfortable talking in front of a group? You can
                        also establish your command of a topic by writing an
                        article that appears in a publication read by your
                        target employer (or employer group). Most professional
                        and industry associations have newsletters and/or web
                        sites that need content, even some businesses (isn&#39;t
                        there a small newsletter-type publication included with
                        your phone bill?). Contact the editor or web master to
                        find out what they need. <br>
                        <br>
                        An article doesn&#39;t need to be long. Just be sure that it
                        is accurate, spelled correctly, and uses good grammar
                        before you submit it. Best - have someone with good
                        writing and spelling skills look at your article to be
                        sure it makes sense before you submit it. <br>
                        <br>

                        <strong>More Tips</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        Writing an article provides you with a terrific excuse to call
                        people for interviews ("Hi, my name is Shirley Yang, and I&#39;m writing an article on the current housing
                        market, may I speak with your president?&quot;)<br>
                        Be sure that you retain the copyright to your article
                        and get a &quot;byline&quot; (as in &quot;by You&quot;). <br>
                        <br>
                        Get a few copies of the article or the right to make
                        copies (some publications will give or sell you reprints
                        of your article as it appeared in their publication, but
                        not give you the right to make copies) to attach to your
                        r&eacute;sum&eacute; when you send a paper version to an employer. <br>
                        Add the article&#39;s title (with the publication&#39;s name and
                        date of publication) to the list of accomplishments on
                        your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. If the article is published on a web site,
                        include the URL on your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Be sure to check the
                        link frequently to make sure that it is still a &quot;live&quot; one.<strong><br>
						<br>
						<br>
						If you are
                          spending more than 2 or 3 hours a day online, spend <i>
                          less</i> time online</strong>.<br>
                        <br>
                        Heresy? No!
                    You&#39;ll get
                        hired by someone who likes you, and the best way to
                        present your charming self is in person. You&#39;ve
                        noticed that it&#39;s not always the most qualified person
                        who gets the job - it&#39;s the person the hiring manager
                        knows. So, get known! Shut down your computer (after
                        you finish reading this article), and go out to make
                        those personal connections that will get you your next
                        job.<br>
                        <br>
                        Web sites and e-mail can lay the groundwork for you,
                        but it&#39;s the person-to-person contact the brings the
                        job offers.<strong><br>
						<br>
						<br>
											  Bottom Line<br>
					    </strong>
                        <br>
                        If you are doing the same things over and over again,
                        but not getting what you want, change your methods
                        because they aren&#39;t working.<br>
                        <br>
                        Maybe you are tired of the whole thing so you are not as
                        effective as you could be, or maybe a few improvements
                        are needed. Find a career coach in your area (or
                        online). Look for a job search support group and get
                        feedback from them on your r&eacute;sum&eacute; or get contact names
                        for your target company, etc. <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Start making phone calls to people who can help you<br>
						</strong>
                        <br>
                        For many of us, this is the hardest thing to do - to ask
                        for help. Don&#39;t be whiny or downbeat (not the time for a
                        long &quot;poor abused me&quot; monolog). After the preliminary
                        pleasantries, state your purpose in calling and your job
                        objective. Then, ask for advice and/or for the name of
                        someone who could help you find that job.<br>
                        <br>
                        Many people really enjoy the opportunity to help because
                        they&#39;ve been through it themselves. And, next time, you
                        may be the right contact for the people who are helping
                        you now. It&#39;s that scary word, &quot;networking &quot; but, with a
                        little practice, you can do it. And, bottom line, you
                        must network to that new job.<br>

                      <h2>Moving Your Job Search Forward</h2>
                      <p class="addspace">Sometimes moving a job
                        search forward feels like trying to run through

                        waist-deep water - extremely difficult! How do
                      you continue to make progress on your job search?</p>
                    <p class="addspace">Particularly if you&#39;ve been unemployed
						for an extended period of time, it&#39;s easy to be
                      discouraged from continuing your career-building work, and do anything else that
						gives you a greater sense of accomplishment. But, you can get that same
                      feeling of accomplishment and move your job search
                      forward at the same time by following these 6 simple
                    steps:
						<br />
						<br />
						<strong>Have a job search
                        goal / focus to your career-building efforts						</strong>
                        <br>
                        Having a goal gives focus to your job
						search/career-building efforts, and makes it easier for
						you to develop a plan to find the type of job you want
						and need.
                        Your goal could be as simple as &quot;to make money&quot; or
						as specific as &quot;become manager of a local branch of
						TD/Canada Trust.&quot; Believe it or not, the
                        simpler goal may be the toughest to achieve because
                        your options for action are endless. Your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and
						cover letters will be
                        unfocused, too, and few people having the power to hire
						you have the time (or the intuition) to figure out what you could
                        be doing for their company. A more specific goal, if it
                        is realistic for you, brings focus and should result in
                        a more effective r&eacute;sum&eacute; and a smarter job search.

                        <strong>Develop your job
                        search plan</strong><br>
                      A goal is usually achieved by taking several steps -
                    accomplishing several things. You can&#39;t get a new job
                    without taking some action. First, you must figure out
                    what you want to do, then pull together and polish a
                    r&eacute;sum&eacute;, then develop a list of potential
                        employers, etc. Sit down and list those major
                        accomplishments, in rough chronological order of their
                        need to be accomplished. For example, you can&#39;t
                        (usually) apply for a job without a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, so
                        developing your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is an important part of your
                        plan.                      <br>
                      <br />
                      <strong>Make a to-do list</strong><br>
                      Break your plan down into the tasks or action items you
                      need to accomplish to reach your goal. And, many tasks
                      contain sub-tasks For example, to write your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, you
                        may want to buy or borrow a good book on writing
                        r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, dig out your old r&eacute;sum&eacute; (if you have one), add
                        your latest job to your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, list the accomplishments
                        associated with that job, line up people to act as
                        references, etc.). Your list won&#39;t be perfect - new
                        tasks will be needed, and other tasks will prove
                        unnecessary. Don&#39;t worry about perfection in this part
                        of your job search. <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Organize your to-do
                        list</strong><br>
                      Obviously, you must accomplish some things before
                      others, and you can often be working on several tasks
                      simultaneously. Shuffle around the items on your to-do
                      list until they are in the order in which they must be
                      accomplished. <br>
                      <br />
                      <strong>Give yourself
                        deadlines</strong><br>
                      Assign deadlines to chunks of tasks (do the first draft
                    of your r&eacute;sum&eacute; by this Friday; get feedback from someone
                        who knows how to create an effective r&eacute;sum&eacute; by next
                        Wednesday; finalize it by next Friday). Be as realistic
                        as you can. Weekly deadlines work best for me, but you
                        may want daily deadlines or monthly ones - whatever
                        works for you. Make a deliberate and unbreakable promise
                        to yourself that you will meet each deadline you set<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Each day, pick one
                        job search &quot;alpha task&quot;</strong><br>
                      Before you begin your day&#39;s work, look at your to-do
                    list and decide which task is THE ONE TASK which
                    MUST be accomplished that day to keep your job search
                    moving forward, even if nothing else gets done.
                    That task is your &quot;alpha task.&quot; <br>
                      <br>
                      Do your day&#39;s alpha task as early in the day as
                      possible. Then, do
                      the next most important, etc. If you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ll
                      discover the sense of accomplishment from getting the
                      alpha task done carries over into a more productive day.
                      And even if you don&#39;t get any other tasks accomplished
                      that day, you will have completed the most critical one,
                      and moved your job search forward. <br>
					  <br>
              That&#39;s progress in your job search, one alpha task at a time.                        </p>

                    <h2>More on Networking: What It Is, and Is Not</h2>
                      <p class="addspace"> Although the technique of networking remains a
                        highly effective job-search and self-marketing tool, the
                        word &quot;networking&quot; repels many people. It&#39;s trite,
                        shopworn, overused, frequently abused, and may be
                        crawling toward oblivion.<br>
                        <br>
                        Nowadays, people often prefer the term &quot;schmoozing&quot; to
                        networking. Others preach &quot;connectivity&quot;. A few still
                        use &quot;informational interviewing&quot;. The label for the
                        process of developing and building informal personal
                        relationships probably shouldn&#39;t much matter  -  a rose
                        by any other name would smell just as sweet, right?
                        Wrong. As Mr. Roper&#39;s reaction suggests, your choice of
                        words may affect the reception you receive from
                        contacts.<br>
                        <br>
                        But you don&#39;t have to take the word seriously to take
                        the technique seriously. While I use the word
                        networking, I often poke fun at it: &quot;Hey, Alf, any
                        chance we might have one of these, ah, &#39;networking&#39;
                        meetings?&quot; (accompanied by a double-handed
                        finger-squiggle to indicate quotation marks around the
                        &quot;N&quot; word).<br>
                        <br>
                        We may rename the process periodically, but it&#39;s still
                        age-old and incredibly powerful. In the job-search
                        sense, it&#39;s using systematic gossip to build informal,
                        low-stakes relationships that improve one&#39;s market
                        visibility, provide the straight scoop about what&#39;s
                        happening and identify still more potential contacts.
                        The key words here are systematic, informal, low-stakes
                        and relationships. When networking is done hit-or-miss,
                        it&#39;s bound to miss something. If it&#39;s stilted and
                        formal, contacts fear they&#39;ve fallen into a high-stakes
                        interaction  -  an interview, even  -  and get defensive.
                        If the interaction isn&#39;t beneficial for both parties, a
                        contact is likely to feel used or manipulated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Humans always can be counted on to help other humans
                        unless their efforts are demeaned or unreciprocated.
                        Most people are remarkably generous with their time and
                        attention. It&#39;s the people who package networking into a
                        canned, impersonal and manipulative shtick who poison
                        the well for those using the technique appropriately and
                        constructively.<br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Basic Rules for Building Rapport</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        Most networking abuses arise because people don&#39;t know
                        how to create relationships. Good networking is about
                        empathy, individualizing the process and understanding
                        basic rules of human interaction. Here are some
                        guidelines:<br>
                        <br>
                        A networking meeting is not a sales transaction; it&#39;s
                        about exchanging information, building trust, being
                        seen, gathering anecdotal information and creating a
                        positive foundation for future interaction.<br>
                        <br>
                        When you ask for a networking meeting, you&#39;re asking for
                        a favor. You want someone to share his or her knowledge
                        and expertise with you. That means you must balance
                        listening with talking. Talk too much, and your expert
                        gets bummed. Maintain too much respectful silence, and
                        you lose your chance to show your flag.<br>
                        <br>
                        Individuals you meet in a networking context need to
                        feel they&#39;re respected, heard and getting, as well as
                        giving, value.<br>
                        <br>
                        The stakes and risks must be kept low and the &quot;fun
                        factor,&quot; high. Lighten up; this isn&#39;t a world peace
                        discussion.<br>
						<br>
						It&#39;s only dishonest if you setup an networking meeting/information
						interview and then ask for a job at the interview. You
						must respect the fact that the
					  purpose of this meeting is to:
                      <ul>
						<li>Build a network of contacts</li>
						<li>Gain information about the hidden job market</li>
						<li>Learn more about what how to take advantage of
						career building opportunities with this employer</li>
						<li>Lean about this employer&#39;s work culture and what
						they look for in prospective new recruits. What does
						this employer consider a &quot;good fit&quot; in terms of culture,

						attitude, experience, and skills? </li>
						<li>Identify your strengths</li>
						<li>Help define your career path</li>
						<li>Open your eyes to career paths that you might not have
						considered</li>
						<li>Get referrals to other job opportunities </li>
					  </ul>
                      <br />
                      <br>
                      <h2>Blowing It Big Time</h2><br>
                      The most serious networking sin is to misrepresent your
                      reason for making the contact. The networker in the
                      opening example later created permanent damage by
                      pulling the &quot;Great Agenda Switch&quot; on Mr. Roper. He asked
                        for a low-stakes chat, but when the meeting started,
                        threw a full-court press on Mr. Roper, badgering him for
                        a job. Mr. Roper threw him out and vowed never to
                      &quot;network&quot; again.<br>
                      <br>
                     Skilled networkers know the importance of a credible
                     &quot;decompression&quot; statement  -  words that set the stage
                        and take the heat off: Norma, I hope I made it clear
                        when I called that I wasn&#39;t expecting you to have an
                        opening or know someone who does. I really want your
                        judgment and opinions on the barriers to entry I might
                        face if I try to move from being a senior HR manager to
                        taking on responsibility for a regional operating
                        group. What I need most is the perspective of experts
                        who know the lay of the land.<br>
                      <br>
                      It isn&#39;t immoral to ask if an opening exists at a
                      certain company, but it&#39;s not networking. That&#39;s &quot;direct
                        contact&quot;  -  a legitimate but a relatively high-stakes
                        job-search gambit: If the person says &quot;yes&quot; or even
                      &quot;maybe,&quot; machinery whirs into motion. The process
                        becomes formal. <u>An interview and a networking meeting
                        are two entirely distinct animals</u>.<br>
                      <br>
                      You may wonder, &quot;Isn&#39;t it dishonest to &#39;decompress&#39; when
                        I know there may be an opening?&quot; You bet  -  but you can
                        cover both alleys without deceit: Ralph, the word is out
                        that you folks may be looking for a director of quality
                        for your new division. If that&#39;s true, I&#39;d really like
                        to throw my hat in the ring. If I&#39;m misinformed and
                        there isn&#39;t an opportunity, I&#39;d still welcome the chance
                        to sit down with you informally and get your thoughts
                        about how to focus my efforts on landing a senior
                        quality-management position. You simply must make your
                        intentions clear.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Troubles With Technique / The Importance of
					  Clearly Stating Your Intentions</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Beware, too, of providing &quot;mush&quot; agendas. That is, many
                        contacts are asked to give up precious time without
                        understanding what&#39;s involved or expected of them. In
                        your initial call or letter, you must provide a frame of
                        reference or agenda telling your contact what she needs
                        to know::<br>
                      <br>
                      Who are you?<br>
                      Why are you calling me?<br>
                      Who gave you my name  -  and why?<br>
                      What kind of knowledge or information do you want from
                      me?<br>
                      What do I need to know about your situation to provide
                      appropriate advice?<br>
                      What are you asking me for? What are the stakes? Are
                      there any risks?<br>
                      <br>
                      Too many networking meetings commence without the
                      &quot;expert&quot; knowing what she&#39;s supposed to be expert
                        in...or what level of help to provide. The job seeker
                        hasn&#39;t taken time to learn if the referral&#39;s level of
                        expertise or sophistication is adequate. Instead, the
                        networker merely invokes the name of a referral source
                        (&quot;Your friend Verona said you&#39;d be great to talk to&quot;)
                        without providing an agenda. The contact meets the
                        networker as a favor to Verona but has nothing to offer.
                        He or she is forced to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ve
                        never heard of that,&quot; which is demeaning or humiliating,
                        then is understandably surly and more likely to take it
                        out on the networker than on Verona.<br>
                      <br>
                      Good networkers respect a contact&#39;s intelligence and
                      wisdom and make an effort to allow the contact to
                      display it. They don&#39;t talk down to them or use jargon
                      that the contact doesn&#39;t understand.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>This Isn&#39;t a Sales Call</strong><br>
                      <br>
                     Communication and self-presentation issues also can
                      dynamite a meeting. We may unintentionally signal that
                      the interaction isn&#39;t genuine or spontaneous. This is
                      the death knell of trust and rapport; the contact
                      worries that he or she is being manipulated. Things cool
                      off fast.<br>
                      <br>
                      <u>Contacts should never feel they&#39;re on the receiving end
                      of a sales pitch</u>. Tricks and gambits salespeople use to
                      &quot;close the sale&quot; are inappropriate during a friendly,
                        low-key conversation. Sales techniques for &quot;overcoming
                        objections&quot; usually are easily recognizable. They tell
                        contacts, &quot;This isn&#39;t a real relationship; it&#39;s a
                        manipulation.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      It&#39;s wise to prepare for networking meetings, and
                      evidence that you&#39;ve done your homework is flattering.
                      However, there&#39;s a distinction between preparing and
                      rehearsing. Anything in your self-presentation that
                      sounds canned or mechanical is a turn-off. Contacts
                      expect to be seen and treated as unique individuals, and
                      if you convey that this meeting is a stock
                      song-and-dance, they&#39;ll resent and perhaps punish you..<br>
                      <br>
                      During the networking meeting...slow...down. Slow your
                      thinking, assumptions, responses and rate of speech.
                      Give yourself time to think, or the contact time to
                      interject. Good networkers practice active listening:
                      They resist interrupting, and paraphrase what the other

                      person says to test their understanding. They appear
                      interested in the contact and reflect on the contact&#39;s
                      comments, asking for elaboration or examples. They
                      interact instead of presenting.<br>
                      <br>
                      Poor networkers speak in ways that makes them sound
                      nervous or pushy  -  babbling or talking breathlessly.
                      The contact thinks, &quot;I wonder why she&#39;s nervous? Maybe
                        she has something to be nervous about.&quot; They may talk
                        too loudly, interrupt or try to trump their contact&#39;s
                        examples (&quot;You think that&#39;s amazing, I remember one time
                        I...&quot;). They take and hold on to the microphone,
                        creating the impression that they&#39;re control freaks,
                        arrogant or opinionated.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Respect Their Time</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      A frequent networking gaffe is lack of respect for the
                      contact&#39;s time. The rule is: Don&#39;t use too much; don&#39;t
                      ask for too little. Keep your eye on your watch. Not
                      offering sincere thanks for referrals is another.
                      Remember, a person has used up a favor to help you. Act
                      promptly on contacts&#39; suggestions. Speak warmly of them
                      to others. Sadly, breaches of confidentiality are
                      surprisingly common. You may assume what you&#39;re hearing
                      is common knowledge, when the contact actually has
                      trusted you with inside information. Assume any
                      information provided is confidential unless you know
                      otherwise. To be absolutely sure, ask.<br>
                      <br>
                      But the most problematic networking lapse is lack of
                      follow-up. Most networkers assume that the technique
                      will pay off right now, in real time (&quot;Gee, ABC has an
                        opening...&quot;). Usually it doesn&#39;t. The best thing you can
                        hope for is that your networking contact becomes a
                        sensitive, positively motivated antenna tuned to your
                        frequency, listening for information that might help
                        you. <br>
					  <br>
					  But, while they may hear something juicy, don&#39;t
                      expect them to call you. You have to follow up
                      periodically. Stay in their line of sight. Send articles
                      of interest. Let them know how your search is going. Be
                      sure to send an updated r&eacute;sum&eacute;. And remember True Life
                        Axiom No. 1: &quot;What goes around, comes around. You don&#39;t
                        know when it will come around, but if you don&#39;t go
                        around, nothing comes around.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      Thoughtful, respectful and considerate networking goes
                      beyond getting job-search help. It can spawn friendships
                      that span years and pay diverse dividends. It&#39;s
                      relationship building, which must stay anchored in the
                      human dimension. Before every networking, informational,
                      connectivity, or schmooze meeting, imagine the
                      interaction from the contact&#39;s viewpoint. Will it be
                      respectful, informative, relaxed, enjoyable and
                      authentic? It&#39;s your job to deliver. If you deliver,
                      networking will deliver.<br>

<h2>Tapping the &quot;Hidden Job Market&quot;</h2>


                      <p class="addspace">The majority of available job opportunities are not
                      advertised. Researchers have found that <strong>between 70 to 80 percent of available jobs are found
                      in what is referred to as a &#39;&#39;hidden job market&quot;. </strong>
                      The following explains the hidden job market concept
                        and offers ideas on how to strengthen your job
                        search.<br>
						<br>
						The hidden job market includes all positions that have
						not yet been communicated through visible channels, such
						as newspapers. These positions are filled by - or
						created for - candidates who come to the employer&#39;s
						attention through employee recommendations, referrals
						from trusted associates, recruiters, or direct contact
						from the candidate.<br>
						<br>
						Successful job seekers who tap into the hidden job
						market are able to connect with the employer&#39;s network.
						Networking - using your contacts to connect with the
						employer&#39;s contact - is the key to tapping into the
					  hidden job market.</p>
                      <p class="addspace">Understanding the hidden job market is at the  heart of the job-hunting process. Not being able to access
                      it often results in an unsuccessful job search, with either no job or a non-targeted
                    position being found.</p>
                    <p class="addspace">These <strong>unadvertised jobs are mostly found through word-of-mouth and
                      networking</strong>. They exist because many employers prefer to hire someone referred
                      to them by someone they know, like a trusted employee or business associate. Some
                      positions are  created because an ideal job candidate just happens to appear at the
                      right time.<br>
					  <br>
					  <strong><br>
					  Developing your network<br>
					  </strong><br>
					  By beginning with a few people and building a base of
						contacts, you can work to develop and expand your list
						of contacts. Start by talking to friends or close
						business associates, generally people with whom you feel
						comfortable. <br>
					  <br>
					  Don&#39;t worry if they are not employed in the
						field in which you are interested; they may know someone
						who is, or at least someone who can connect you with the
						right person. Let them know that you are looking for a
						job, what type of job you are looking for and your
						skills. State that you would welcome advice, suggestions
						and ideas. <br>
					  <br>
					  <br>
					  <strong>Expanding your network<br>
					  </strong><br>
					  Once you have talked to people close to you, you will
						become more confident and better prepared, and be ready
						to contact people you know less well.<br>
					  <br>
					  Examples of contacts:
              <div>
						<p class="addspace">Colleagues, previous employers;<br>
						University / college classmates, faculty;<br>
						Community members in clubs ;<br>
						Family members, neighbors and friends;<br>
						Members of University / college clubs, organizations,
						associations; and<br>
			  Members of clubs, teammates on sports teams.			            </div>
		              <p class="addspace">
						You cannot predict who will be able to help you; so talk
						to as many people as you can.
						The more people you contact, the better your chances of
						finding a job lead. With each
						contact, focus your request by letting him/her know what
						you want - a job lead, a lead to
						a key contact in the industry or specific company, or a
						lead to anyone they think might be
						able to help you in your job search.<br>
						Start your networking by asking people if they have
						heard of any job openings. List 10
						people you can start with today. Continually add to this
						list as you develop your network. <br>
						<br>
						As you build your list, keep a record of who helped you
						and how they helped. Try to
						send them a thank-you note or call them to let them know
						their lead paid off.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Whether it&#39;s for the purpose of expanding your contacts
                      through conducting &quot;<strong>information interviews</strong>&quot; with
                      people having the power to hire you, or for the purpose of
                      directly applying for jobs, the most
                      effective ways to arrange a meeting or interview with
                    prospective employers are:</p>
		              <blockquote>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
						  <p class="addspace">Using your contacts<br />
					      Applying directly to the company by going there in person<br />
					      <br />
				        Using a combination of methods:<br />
                        making an appointment by phone

						  <p class="addspace">sending a marketing letter and r&eacute;sum&eacute; followed by phone calls
						  <p class="addspace">using information from networking and employer research, and
						  <p class="addspace">having a systematic approach to your job search                                                     </li>
                        </ul>
                      </blockquote>
		            <p class="addspace">Your preparation pays off now. Use the valuable
                      information you have assembled - your top skills, the employers&#39; needs,
                      contacts, and your company research to set up a meeting. Above all, be politely
                    persistent, and follow through diligently.</p>
		            <p class="addspace">Instead of advertising, which takes time and money, an
                      employer can find employees referred to them who are well suited to their
                      operation, without the bother of a formal recruitment process. In other words,
                      you make life easier for employers by being proactive in your job search.</p>
              <br><br />


              <h2>The Many Advantages of the Hidden Job Market</h2>

              One of the advantages of tapping into the hidden job
                      market is there will be less competition for you than if
                      you apply to a position that is being advertised. Also,
                      you may find work that better suits your skills and
                      abilities because you are going after the company you want
                      to work for.
					  <p class="addspace"></p>
					<p class="addspace">There are many facets to learning how to succeed in the
                      hidden job market. If you feel uncertain, then seek the
                      help of others. Take a job-finding course offered in your
                      community. Human Resources Development Canada
                    offer free three-week workshops for the unemployed. </p>
					<p class="addspace">By joining a workshop you will immediately increase
                      your network, gain confidence and learn more about the
                      community in which you live.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<a name="buildnetwork"></a>
<h2>Build a Network</h2>
					<p class="addspace">Networking is a huge part of finding unadvertised
                      vacancies and is the number one way to find a good job.&nbsp;
                      For these reasons every job seeker needs to learn how to build a
                      network as part of targeting employers. Do this by starting with the people you  know or those you
                      meet each day. Make sure everyone you know is
                      aware that you are looking for  work, and be as specific
                      as you can in letting them know your talents. <br>
                      <br>
                      Remember that networking is about developing professional
                      relationships, and is a life skill that can help guide
                      your career. Keep in mind that your ultimate goal in
                      networking as part of your job search is to get interviews
                      with people who have the authority to hire you. Ask your
                      contacts face-to-face or on the telephone for their help
                      because letters do not work as well. Networking is about
                      building relationships. Your contacts must trust you in
                    order for them to refer you personally.</p>
					  <p class="addspace">For example, &quot;I am seeking a software development job in
                      the&nbsp; Vancouver area, preferably using Microsoft development
                      technologies.&quot; You need to have a clear occupational
                    goal before you start building your network. </p>
					<p class="addspace">If your contacts have no suggestions to offer, ask them if they
                      know anyone&nbsp;you could talk to about your software
                      development (for example)
                      interest. Treat each networking contact as a mentor or
                      advisor. Do not ask your contacts for a job, because if
                      they know of a job working for their employer, they will
                      volunteer that information if they think you are
                      qualified.<br>
                      <br>
                      Gradually, you will start to build a larger network of
                      people who may connect you to an opportunity. See
                      <a href="#networking">Networking Basics</a>, below. <br>

<h2>Using the Art of Cold-Calling to Meet Decision Makers and Extend Your Network</h2>
					<p class="addspace">As part of network-building, you will need to learn to
                      do cold calls to employers who are not advertising. This
                      can be hard work, especially  for individuals who
                      believe they can not market themselves. <br>
					  <br>
                      Here&#39;s how cold-calling works: You call the targeted
                      company and ask to speak to a targeted contact - someone
                      having the power to hire you. If you
                      have the name of a referral, always use it as soon as
                      possible. When you get that decision maker on the line,
                      give them your 30-second commercial and then ask for a
                      meeting. Follow a script and use information about their
                      company to show that you are knowledgeable about their
                      business. It is very important to write your script the
                      way you talk, to make it sound natural. After writing it
                      out and practicing, jot down the main points you want to
                      make so you will speak naturally.<br>

					  <strong>Cold-Calling Tips</strong></p>


						<p class="addspace">Leave a message for a specific person. Anyone can call
						and say they&#39;re simply calling about a job or possible
						opening. If you do a little research to find out who you
						should speak to, it will only pay off. It will show that
						you have a sincere interest in the job and you&#39;re not
						afraid to go the extra mile to get what you want.


						<p class="addspace">Always know your employer. Find out about the company
						you&#39;re applying for so you can communicate to them how
						compatible you are as a candidate.

						<p class="addspace">Practice what you&#39;re going to say. You don&#39;t want to
						sound like you&#39;re reading a script, but the more
						prepared you are, the more confident you will sound. Not
						to mention, if you&#39;re prepared to leave a message and
						you get a person instead, your delivery will be that
						much better.

					  <p class="addspace"><strong><br>
					  Try this script, and then develop one of your own</strong>:<br>
						<br>Hello ___. My name is ___ and I was referred to you by
                      ___. I am a ___ and my skills include (and/or
                      accomplishments) include ___ and ___ and ___. I would like
                      to meet with you to learn more about your company. When
                      would be a good time for you?<br>
						<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>If you have trouble getting through to the decision-maker,
                      try these methods: </strong>                      </p>
					<ul>
                      <li>
					  <p class="addspace">Mention the name of your referral<br />
					    Call before or after business hours or during lunch<br />
					    Get referred from a higher office such as the
                      president&#39;s personal assistant<br />
                      Mail a letter and r&eacute;sum&eacute; stating you will call at a
                      specific time and date. Then your call will be expected.<br />
                      Ask what time they will be available, and call back.<br />
                      Call with confidence, asking for the person by their
                      first name, as if you were a personal friend<br />
                      Ask the secretary or assistant for help.<br />
                      <br />
                      If nothing else works, leave a message on voice mail
                      using your 30-second commercial. <br />
                      Be persistent, even if it means calling every day for
                      ten days.<br />
                      If they are not in a position to hire you, then ask if
                      they know someone who might. If they refer you to someone,
                      then ask if you can use their name and send them a thank
                      you letter and networking card.</li>
              </ul>
					<p class="addspace">Even though it is easier to stay home and check the
                      newspapers and job web sites daily or to wait until a company phones after you
                      have submitted a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, this method of job search is far
                      less effective. Your success as a job seeker/career
                      builder is tightly tied to how much work you put into <strong>
                      directly</strong> finding job openings and what you&nbsp; do to
                      take advantage of them in a timely manner. <br>

              <h2>Applying for Work in Person</h2>

              <br />
              Applying for work in person works well with small companies
regardless of position. When you arrive, ask for your
contact by name after having found this information as
part of your employer research.
If he or she will not see you then, then make an
appointment. Use your 30-second commercial to explain the
reason. You want an appointment regardless of whether
there are openings. If all else fails, then fill out an
application, or leave your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and make a follow-up
phone call the next day, and the next day...<br>
                      <br>
                      It takes a  degree of confidence to walk into a
                      store or company and drop off a r&eacute;sum&eacute; and ask to speak to
                      a manager about job opportunities. Many
                      people find it even more difficult to call back later to see if
                      anything has materialized. It is difficult if you
                      feel that you are being rejected over and over again. Tell
						yourself &quot;so
                      what,&quot; and keep going!<br>
                      <br>
                      If you are rejected, either&nbsp; the company is a poor match
                      with your talents, or they just missed an important
                      recruitment opportunity, or they are not hiring, or you
                      need to strengthen some skills, or the manager just hired
                      his niece, or ... you may never know!

<h2>Understanding the Job Search Challenge and the Importance of Generating Leads</h2>
<p class="addspace">

<strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
   					  <p class="addspace">Suppose you meet a job seeker whose frustration is nearly a month old.
    					  You ask the cause of his consternation, and he responds with a familiar
    					  lament: &quot;My job search is going nowhere.&quot;			                      </p>
			  <p class="addspace">From the looks of the guy, he has been diligent in his pursuit of
    					  employment, so you ask incredulously, &quot;You mean you haven&#39;t found a single
			  job opening you would consider applying for?&quot; </p>
			  <p class="addspace">The guy stares at you, as though he was trying to read something on your
			  face. You&#39;ve clearly asked the wrong thing, but he answers anyway. </p>
			  <p class="addspace">&quot;The truth is, I&#39;ve got a notebook at home that&#39;s full of promising-and
    					  open-positions.&quot; He pauses, before emphatically continuing: &quot;And I&#39;ve applied for
    					  most of them. Sent in my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, which I spent $250 on, and even called to
    					  confirm that they had received it. I&#39;ve been following up ever since, just
    					  to see how everything is going. I get the same thing every time, &#39;We&#39;ll get
			  back to you when we make our decision.&#39;&quot; </p>
			  <p class="addspace">You say nothing because you simply don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to have your
			  career off the hook indefinitely. </p>
			  <p class="addspace">As if to break the uncomfortable silence, he says, &quot;I haven&#39;t gotten a
    					  single offer yet. I mean, I&#39;ve only been at it for three-and-a-half-weeks,
    					  but come on! I know I&#39;m qualified to fill these positions. My job search
    					  isn&#39;t leading anywhere, like it&#39;s in a holding pattern. I don&#39;t know what
			  I&#39;m doing wrong.&quot; </p>
			  <p class="addspace"><strong><br>
			  What do you say?</strong> <br>
			    <br>
			    This guy isn&#39;t getting what he wants out of his job search because he
			    isn&#39;t getting what he needs from it. He needs interviews to obtain job
			    offers. Here&#39;s your advice: <i>If your job search is coming up &quot;empty,&quot; it&#39;s
    					    because you aren&#39;t getting interviews. You need to try different search
    					    methods until you find one that works for you. You&#39;ll know it when you start
		      landing interview opportunities.</i> </p>
			  <p class="addspace">Does this mean that the job search is hit-or-miss? Is your best strategy
    					  just to try different strategies until you find one that works? Should
			    &quot;luck&quot; be how you find a job?<strong><br>
              </strong><br>

                <strong>
                <br>
              2. The Numbers Game</strong><p class="addspace">The job search is a numbers game:</p>
		              <p align="center" class="addspace">
		                <strong><i>More Leads </i>=<br>
              MORE CHANCES TO GET INTERVIEWS =</strong></p>
              <p align="center" class="addspace"><i><strong>More Opportunities to
			              Receive Job Offers</strong> =<br>
              </i><strong>GREATER ODDS OF BECOMING EMPLOYED</strong></p>
              <p class="addspace">No search method is a sure thing. It could generate many leads, but no
			              interviews. Or, it could produce one lead, which gets you the &quot;winning&quot;
                interview and a job offer. You just never know. Luck can be a major factor
                in determining the outcome of your job search. But it doesn&#39;t have to be the
                <i>only</i> factor. That&#39;s because not all jobs leads are as productive as
			              others. And, if your leads aren&#39;t productive, having more of them does not
			              translate into more employment opportunities. To illustrate this point, take
              a look at the following statistics:</p>
              <p align="left" class="addspace">Of the people who have gotten jobs in the last fifteen years,</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p align="left" class="addspace">35% heard about an opening from someone<br>
                  30% contacted their present employer directly<br>
                  14% answered a want ad<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; 6% were referred by private employment agencies<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; 5% were referred by state employment agencies<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; 2% took civil service tests<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; 8% used other methods (e.g., placing ads in career <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; journals,&nbsp;attending career fairs, and mass mailing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; r&eacute;sum&eacute;s)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="addspace">There&#39;s no doubt job seekers can find <i>a lot</i> of leads by reading
			              the want ads, using placement services and/or advertising their availability
			              to employers. Such are the tried-and-true methods of the traditional job
			              search. People have been doing it this way for a long time, and the reason
			              is leads. These methods turn up leads, often in staggering quantities. Think
			              about it: How many leads could you get right now from people you know that
			              you couldn&#39;t find in the want ads? Add that to the number of employers
			              you&#39;re on a first-name basis with and ...well, enough said. You&#39;d probably
              find twice as many leads in the Sunday paper.</p>
              <p class="addspace">But would you find the lead-that-got-the-interview-that-got-you-the-job?
			              Maybe. If you polled 100 recently employed people, on average, 35 would have
			              found that lead through traditional search methods. That leaves 65 who
              wouldn&#39;t have. They did better with fewer leads.</p>
              <p align="center" class="addspace"><strong><i><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">More people get jobs with fewer leads, and fewer
			              people get jobs with more leads.</span></i></strong><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">

              3. Quality Vs. Quantity</strong></p>
              <p class="addspace">Are 65% of job seekers luckier than their peers? No. They just have
			              better leads, meaning ones with better-than-average chances of leading to
			              interviews. Most leads - those found through traditional search methods -
			              don&#39;t yield many interviews. Why? Because they are passive approaches to the
			              job hunt. Answering want ads, using placement agencies and mass-mailing
			              r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are essentially passive exercises because, once you correspond with
			              HR departments and recruiters, you must wait for them to contact you. And,
			              the odds aren&#39;t very good that they will respond with an interview
			              opportunity.              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p class="addspace">Ads in newspapers elicit hundreds of responses, so the numbers dictate
			                  that less than one-thirtieth of those respondents will ever get an
			                  interview-let alone a job!&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          <p class="addspace">Recruiters usually specialize in certain fields or industries, which
            means that you must match up before you are even considered for placement.
            Furthermore, out of every 100 job seekers who use this method, only
            between 5 and 24 will find a job thereby. That leaves 76-95 people who
            won&#39;t find jobs through recruiters. <br>
  &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          <p class="addspace">Just sending out r&eacute;sum&eacute;s can be a waste of time. If your r&eacute;sum&eacute; ever
            makes it anywhere other than the back logs of an electronic database, your
          chances of getting a job are approximately 7%.&nbsp; </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="addspace">Why are these numbers so low despite the leads being so plentiful?
			              Competition: These jobs openings are advertised to the general public so
			              everyone-and-his-mother can apply for the position. The numbers simply
			              aren&#39;t in your favor. Employers can conduct only so many interviews, which
			              means that the first thing they must do is weed-out 90% of the applicants.
			              Having more leads does increase your chances of being the one person in ten
			              who actually gets an interview. But, how many times will you be lucky enough
              to be that person? Maybe twice, three times...</p>
              <p class="addspace"><i><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Most openings are with smaller organizations</span>.</i> The most recent data
			              suggests that about 70% of all non-governmental workers now work for small
			              employers. These are employers with 250 or fewer employees. It follows,
			              moreover, that most of the new jobs are with&nbsp; small
              organizations, and this has been true for some time now.</p>
              <p class="addspace"><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">These facts have a number of consequences for your job search</span>. Smaller
			              employers tend not to have personnel offices, so asking to fill out an
			              application or send in a r&eacute;sum&eacute; to the personnel department just doesn&#39;t
			              make much sense with them. And, because there are many more small employers
			              than large ones, they are often harder to find or even to know about.&nbsp;<br />
			              <br />
			              This
			              is just one of many reasons why you will find using the
		                  <a href="index.html" title="Vancouver Job Search software and Employers Database" target="_blank"> Job Search software</a> mentioned on this web site very cost and time effective, as most of the over 8,100 Vancouver and area employers included in its database are small companies.

			              because employers appreciate the fact that you know their needs having
              researched their organization. </p>
              <p class="addspace">Even larger corporations have begun to decentralize, and are delegating hiring
			              decisions to smaller, local branches not having Human Resources departments. <i>The Result</i>: Larger organizations act more like small ones
			              in the way they hire people. Hence, the
                <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">traditional job search approaches -
              namely, the passive ones - are less effective than ever</span>.</p>
              <p class="addspace"><u>Question</u>: How do you locate these jobs and/or get interviews
              with these companies?</p>
              <p class="addspace"><u>Answer</u>: By utilizing your network of contacts to make your
			              availability and qualifications known to people who have the power to hire

                          common. As a job seeker, your network is made up of all the people who can
                          help you, as well as the people they know who can help you. <strong>Networking</strong>
                        is the process you use to identify and contact these people, letting them
                        know of your availability and qualifications for a particular job.              </p>
              <p class="addspace"><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Building a personal network is a vital part of your career&nbsp;
              development.
              Each planned contact can lead to unexpected ones, if you ask the right
              questions and explore the possibilities.</span> You can learn how to make your
                          contacts work to your advantage by providing you with advice, information
                          and referrals. As you can see, networking is a deliberate process,
                <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">the goal
                            of which is to get a face-to-face interview with someone who has the power
                to hire you</span>. The underlying principle of networking is this: Y<i>ou are more
                              likely to get an appointment to see people you don&#39;t know personally if
                              someone they know refers you to them.</i> Through a sequence of referrals,
                          you will get your qualifications in front of dozens of people very&nbsp;quickly
              - any one of whom could lead you to an interview with a potential employer.</p>
              <p align="center" class="addspace">There are two routes you can take to reach that person:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p class="addspace">You can develop a list of &quot;target&quot; companies you want to work for, and
                              then identify the people who could hire you there. As you speak with your
                              contacts, you would seek referrals to the people on your list. You might
                              be surprised to find out how many people you know that know someone, who
                              knows someone, who knows the very person with whom you want to interview.<br>
  &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          <p class="addspace">The other route is less direct: You can simply follow the network
            wherever it leads, and trust that it will lead to someone who will hire
            you. Whenever a job lead turns up, you&#39;ll want to pursue it immediately
          and vigorously. </li>
              </ul>

    5. Developing Your Network: Honing in on
    Your Targets</strong></p>
              <p class="addspace">Apart from targeting certain people and companies, where can you start
                          your networking? While you never know in advance exactly who will help you
                          and who will not, don&#39;t overlook anyone or decide in advance that he or she
                          won&#39;t assist you. Keep in mind that you probably have more (and better)
                          contacts than you might think; they are simply a few steps down the
                          networking chart. What follows is a list of potential sources for personal
                          contacts. Consider each sphere of &quot;relations&quot; carefully; you never know who
                          might be able to help in your job search.              </p>

    6. How to Make and Keep A Contact</strong></p>
<p class="addspace"><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Networking is not begging.</span>
                        <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">You should not be asking for a job;
                        you should be seeking information that may lead to a job.</span> Contrary to
                          popular conceptions of it, the purpose of networking is not to get a job.
                          It&#39;s to get introductions to companies that may have job openings and to
                          people who may know about certain open positions within a particular field.
                        <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Ask for help and you&#39;ll probably receive it. Ask for a job and you&#39;ll be
                        directed to Human Resources. </span>                      </p>
              <p class="addspace">Here are six rules for effective networking:</p>
              <p class="addspace"><strong><i><br />
              Rule #1: Get Started - Set Up a Meeting</i></strong></p>
              <p class="addspace">The basic criterion for a person to be in your network is that he or she
                          is willing to talk to you. This should include just about everyone, so
                          select those who seem most likely to know lots of other people. The
                          objective of your first interaction is to obtain an appointment with that
                          person/contact. Hence, some short explanatory conversation is in order, one
                          that explains the purpose of your meeting - namely, to exchange information.
                          ...<i>Keep in Mind:</i> Pushing too hard for an appointment or for
                          information will surely backfire on you: You could offend the very person
              you want to impress.&nbsp; Remember to respect their time.</p>
              <p class="addspace"><strong><i><br />
              Rule #2: Present Yourself Well</i></strong></p>
              <p class="addspace">It is essential that each contact in your network ends up thinking well
                          of you. To increase the chances that they will, it helps to be friendly,
                          well organized, polite and interested in what they have to say. No one <i>
                          has</i> to see you, so be on your best behavior, as though you were meeting
              with a perfect stranger, even if you know the person well.</p>
              <p class="addspace"><strong><i><br />
              Rule #3: Learn Something</i></strong></p>
              <p class="addspace">Be open to learn from your contacts, even if they don&#39;t know very much
                          about the type of job you are seeking. Do try, however, to keep things
                          centered on your goal, which is to make more contacts and to get more job
                          leads. Of course, in situations where the contact does know about the type
                          of job you want, there will be much to learn from them. They can tell you
                          about what is going on in the field and other details that will be helpful
              for you to know.</p>
              <p class="addspace"><strong><i><br />
              Rule #4: Get Two Referrals</i></strong></p>
              <p class="addspace">Getting referrals is essential to developing a network, so don&#39;t give up
                          until you have at least two names of other people who might help you in your
                          job search. You can get referrals from virtually anyone, but only if you are
                          persistent in asking for them. Here are three questions that will generally
                          get you one or more referrals, but often only after you ask the second or
              third questions:<br />
              <br />
              Do you know of anyone who might have an opening for a person with my
              skills? If no, then,
              <br />
              <br />
              Do you know of anyone else who <i>might</i> know of someone who would?
          If still no, then,
              <br />
              <br />
              Do you know someone who knows a lot of people (in this or that field)?          </p>
              <p class="addspace"><br />
                Get used to asking each of the three questions until you get what you
                          want - either a lead for a possible job opening, or the names of two people
                          who might be of assistance to you in your search. When you receive a &quot;yes&quot;
                to any of these questions, make sure to get the details of the person to
                contact, including the correct spelling of his or her name and how to
                contact him or her.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
              <strong><i><br />
              Rule #5: Follow Up on Referrals</i></strong>
              <p class="addspace">When you get the name of a new contact, you should follow up immediately.
                          In most cases, you are better off to make the contact yourself, rather than
                          to wait for your existing contact to make the call for you. This approach
                          allows you to make sure that there is no delay in making the contact and
              assures that you maintain control of the contact and networking processes.</p>
              <p class="addspace">As you make more contacts, you will quickly begin to be referred to
                          people you don&#39;t know. The nature of the process encourages each person to
                          refer you to someone who knows even more about the job you want than he or
                          she does. As you get referred along, you will begin to meet some very
                          knowledgeable people who will tell you things you need to know. The more of
                          them you see, the more you learn, and the better prepared you are for future
                          contacts and for interviews. With each level of referral, you are also more
                          likely to meet people who have the ability to hire you or who know others
              who do.</p>
              <p class="addspace">You have thus entered the &quot;<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">hidden job market</span>.&quot; Most of the people you
                          meet through networking in this way do not have jobs open or are unlikely to
                          hire someone like you. However, they do know other people and are often
                          willing to refer them to you - or tell someone else about you who, in turn,
                <i>has</i> an opening.&nbsp; In short, you are now in a position to be considered
                          for future job openings. You have come to be known to them in the early
                          stages of a job opening. While others are waiting for jobs to be advertised
                          in the want ads, you are getting there before it is. You have a chance to
              get the job before it is ever advertised.</p>
              <p class="addspace">Here are some questions that you might ask during a referral or
              informational interview:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                <p class="addspace">How did you get into the field? <br />
                  How does your organization differ from others in the field?<br />
                  How is it similar to others in the field?<br />
                  What trends do you see in this career field? How can I take advantage
          of them?<br />
          Do you have any ideas how a person with my background and skills might
          find a job in this field?<br />
          From your point of view, what problems are most important to overcome
            in this career area?<br>
  &nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
              <p class="addspace">Recent graduates or those new to the field should also consider asking
              questions like:&nbsp;</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                <p class="addspace">What are the things you like best (or least) about your work?<br />
                Can you describe a typical day or week in your office?<br />
                What was your career path? Is it typical?<br />
                What is the job market currently like in this field?<br />
                What are some of the positive and negative aspects of this field?<br />
                What are the important skills I should have to be successful in this
          field? </li>
        </ul>
              <p class="addspace"><strong><i><br />
              Rule #6: Send Thank-You Notes</i></strong></p>
              <p class="addspace">Sending someone a thank-you note is a simple gesture of appreciation.
                          These people have spent some of their valuable time helping to further your
                          job search, so it is more than good manners to follow-up with a brief
                          message expressing your gratitude to them. Thank-you notes also have
                          practical benefits since the person who receives it is more likely to
                          remember you and perceive you as being thoughtful and well organized.
                          Impressions matter, and thank-you notes help to create positive ones.<br />

              <br>
              7. <strong>Networking Over the Phone</strong>

              <p class="addspace">The phone is an important tool to use in your job search, particularly
                          when it comes to securing informational interviews with people to whom your
                          contacts refer you. In this type of situation, it is necessary to know what
                          to say in the short conversation that will serve as the prelude to - and
                          rationale for - your face-to-face meeting. You should be able to complete
                          your conversation within five minutes. Thus, it is necessary to develop a
                  script for your conversation. Be sure to go through each of these steps:<br />
                  <br />
                  Identify yourself.  &nbsp;<br />
                  Establish connectivity. Mention the name of the person you both know
            and whom you have spoken to recently.<br>
Tell why you&#39;re calling. Fore example, you might say: &quot;It&#39;s time for
            me to make a move. I was just laid off along with a thousand others, and
            I&#39;m looking for advice about and guidance on my job search.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            <strong><i>Do not </i></strong>say you are &quot;...looking for a job...&quot; or anything
            similar, for you run the risk of being interrupted with a &quot;no.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br />
Ask specifically for a 15-20 minute appointment, either in person or
over the phone. <br />
During the appointment, you should discuss the industry, the areas of
opportunity and the people worthwhile to contact.<br>

					  8. Networking in a Formal Setting</strong></p>
                      <p class="addspace">Sometimes, you will have the occasion to network at gatherings, such as
                          cocktail parties and conventions. Here are some strategies for breaking the
                          ice while not seeming too aggressive:              <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Don&#39;t worry about having something clever to say.</strong> Successful
                              networkers do not waste their time trying to think of the &quot;perfect&quot;
                  opening line. Instead, they approach potential contacts by making a simple
                  comment to establish common ground. They use small talk to pave the way to
                  more important topics.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>...Handling Crowds: </i>If you want to approach someone talking with a
                              group of people, but not seem like you&#39;re barging in on the conversation,
                              consider saying something like: &quot;May I join you, or is this a private
                              conversation?&quot; Most likely, you will be welcomed into the group.<br>
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Help people to remember your name.</strong> Studies show that people
            usually forget names within thirty seconds of hearing them for the first
            time. Always introduce yourself by name as soon as you meet someone, but
            assume he or she won&#39;t remember your name. After you&#39;ve talked for a few
            minutes, remind the person of your name. This saves him or her the
            embarrassment of asking for your name again. It also increases the chances
            that he or she will remember it.<br>
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Spend at least five minutes with everyone you meet.</strong> This is
            usually enough time to establish connectivity without seeming too rushed.
            If the other person starts glancing around the room or fidgeting, you
            should take this as your cue to move on.<br>
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Spend 80% of the time listening.</strong>
                  <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The best way to show new
              acquaintances you&#39;re interested in what they have to say is to pay close
            attention to them.&nbsp;</span><br>
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Keep your business cards in a pocket</span>.</strong> That way, you won&#39;t have
            to waste valuable time looking for your cards when you only have a few
            minutes to chat with someone.<br>
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Depart gracefully.</strong> In most situations, it is acceptable to ask
            if the person will excuse you because you see someone you need to speak
            to. However, if you&#39;re speaking to someone with higher seniority at a
            business event, use an exit line complementary to his or her status. For
            example, &quot;<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">I don&#39;t want to monopolize your time. I know there are a lot of
  people here who want to speak with you.</span>&quot;<br />

					  <strong>9. Networking Online</strong></p>
                      <p class="addspace">Advantages: E-networking allows you to create a virtual network of
                          contacts, who can provide critical information on job leads, industry trends
                          and unadvertised position openings. These are all contacts that you would
                          never have made using traditional networking methods. <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, online
                        interactions do not involve phone calls or face-to-face meetings, so this
                        eliminates any first-encounter &quot;jitters&quot; you may experience in real world
                          settings. Perhaps the two most important benefits of e-networking relate to
                          its immediacy:              <br />
                          <br />
                        Networking online does not require an introduction from a primary
                            contact on your networking list.<br>
  &nbsp;<br />
  You get immediate responses from people. Email eliminates the
            possibility of having to play phone tag. This increases the productivity
  of your networking endeavors. </p>
              <p class="addspace">To maximize your networking efforts, consider the following strategies
              for effective online contact making: <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Initiate contacts widely, but continue selectively. </strong>Because you
                              don&#39;t have personal introductions to pave the way when networking on the
                              web, it is important to make every effort to put yourself in front of as
                              many people as possible. You will probably go through many more responses
                              than you will find useful networking partners. Thus, it is important to
                              cast a wide net in the early stages of e-networking. <br>
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Identify yourself. </strong>Because you are using these dialogues for
            business purposes <i>only</i> (i.e., to enhance your job search efforts),
            there is no reason to use an alias or any other pretense that would make
            someone uncomfortable and therefore reticent to network with you. People
            who are also networking for business and/or career reasons will recognize
            that, and they will respond accordingly. <br>
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Follow standard business courtesy.</strong> Make your communications
            friendly but also respectful. You take your job search seriously, so you
            should take networking seriously, even if it takes place by email. Do not
            use acronyms or abbreviations (e.g. BTW, FYI, IMHO, etc.) in any of your
            business communications. <br>
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Develop an email template for your job search</span>. </strong>When you
            identify an e-networking prospect, begin corresponding with him or her
          using an email template that displays the following information:  <br />
          <br />
          How you located or identified that person as a potential contact
		          (e.g., both members of the same networking site, both went to the same
          university, etc.) <br />
          <br />
          The nature of your connectivity (e.g., both worked for the same
                company, both worked in the same field/industry, both have similar
          goals, etc.) <br />
          <br />
          A request for further information about a particular industry,
          about open positions, etc. </p>

<h2>Information Interview / Job Interview Preparation</h2>
<p class="addspace">You can&#39;t just walk into an employer&#39;s office and say &quot;so, what is this
job you are interviewing me for and how do I fit into your scheme?&quot;
Employers expect you to know who they are, what they do, what the job
entails, and how you fit into the company structure and culture before you meet with them.</p>
              <p class="addspace">Think of your job interview as the sales call where you get to sell your
                          product. You&#39;ve already sent your marketing brochure <i>(your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and
                            cover letter)</i>, and they&#39;re interested. The interview is your chance to
                          make the final pitch to sell yourself to the hiring manager. Like any good sales professional,
                          you have to know what they are buying in order to make the right pitch. </p>
              <font face="Arial">
              <p class="addspace"><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"><strong>Start
                          you employer research at the employer&#39;s website</strong></span>. <br>
                Consider this to be a book about the employer <strong>by</strong> the
                          employer! Read it &quot;cover to cover&quot; and print pages which interest you or
              which have information you want to double-check.  </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p class="addspace">Look at anything that says <strong>News</strong> or <strong>What&#39;s
                              New</strong>. This will give you the latest information on what is happening
                and possible clues on new areas or projects you might fit into. </li>
        <li>
          <p class="addspace">Read any <strong>mission statements</strong> or <strong>description
            of services</strong> to see how this organization describes itself. Use this to
          customize your cover letter to their interests. </li>
        <li>
          <p class="addspace">Look for an <strong>annual report</strong> or <strong>strategic plan</strong>
          and read it carefully. </li>
        <li>
          <p class="addspace">Check out the <strong>career opportunities, jobs, and/or
            human resource area</strong>. Realize that there be many job openings that are
            not posted online, but read over the instructions on applying. Use this as
            a guide to their application procedures, and look for information on their
          benefits. </li>
        <li>
          <p class="addspace">Look over the whole site. What does the design of
            these pages say to you about this organization? Are they conservative or
          funky, are they well-organized or difficult to follow? </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="addspace">Don&#39;t be afraid to refer to the website when you are in your interview.
                          It will reinforce your knowledge and skills on the Internet. Many employers
                          don&#39;t know what their pages say or haven&#39;t seen them before. You might want
                          to bring some copies of certain pages with you, (but don&#39;t point out their
              spelling errors!) </p>
              <p class="addspace">Then, check business directories and other employer information sources for outside profiles of the employers.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, turn to the Search Engines, and look for more information anywhere you can find it. Why? Well, as one job seeker put it, </p>

                <p class="addspace">&quot;The employer&#39;s website told me what
                            they wanted me to know,
                  but I found what I wanted to know by

<h2>Finding Jobs with Information Technology Employers</h2>

<p class="addspace">
Like in many industries, there are thousands of IT workers looking for better paying,
more interesting work, and many of them are more experienced than you. Is it time to give up and cook burgers?
Not yet, because <strong>companies very often hire on the basis of whether they think
an individual will fit in</strong>. <strong><br>

<br>
Most programming and other IT work does not require
brilliance, it requires a decent understanding, and the ability to work well
with other people in  a  stressful environment. </strong><br>
                <br>
                While brilliance is great in areas where you have really tough problems,
                these employers are most often interested in finding team oriented people, with good
                communication skills - someone who &#39;feels&#39; like they can follow the mode of operation
                that company employs.<br>
                <br>
                Being technically competent is about 1/3 of what it takes to succeed in
                getting and holding on to employment. People and communication skills (also
                known as soft skills) are equally important: the ability to speak clearly,
                write comprehensible memos, document and design, present your ideas
                cogently, attend meetings and hold your own at them without being
                brow-beaten, get along with others on your team, etc., account for another
                1/3. <br>
                <br>
                Trust relationships are critical.&nbsp;You need to develop trusted
                          relationships in the programming community.&nbsp;Employers will go with someone
                          recommended to them by someone they trust, rather than choosing someone who looks
                          brilliant on paper but who is otherwise unknown to them.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                According to job search experts, 80 to 90 percent
                of open IT positions are found in the tech departments of non-IT companies.
                Think of what this means in terms of your time and energy spent applying to
                IT vs. non-IT employers, attending networking events, etc.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
<h2>Does your R&eacute;sum&eacute; Get Past the Company Firewall?</h2>
                      <p class="addspace">Many people know that internet service providers like Telus and Shaw Cable use firewalls which interact with
						our email, deleting some messages, and marking others as &quot;SPAM&quot;.&nbsp;What
						you may be less aware of are internal company &quot;intranet&quot; firewalls which
						scrutinize email to keep out spam and a spate of damaging computer viruses.
						They unintentionally also may block all sorts of legitimate e-mail, including email
						containing job seekers&#39; r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. In fact, while few companies are talking about it,
						recruiting-technology advisors say that r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are among the files commonly deleted.<br>
<br />
						Since many employers advise applicants to send r&eacute;sum&eacute;s via e-mail rather than the
						post office, the issue of disappearing r&eacute;sum&eacute;s can cause problems for both
						job seekers and employers.

<br />
<br />
When emailing your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is a requirement, one step you can take to know that it  arrived at its destination is to send registered email. Another way to know they received it is to ask for confirmation that it was received, but you often can't expect to receive a personalized acknowledgement when your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is one of hundreds submitted, and for this reason sending your r&eacute;sum&eacute; by registered email may be your best option.
<br />
<br />
Also,  the notification you receive when they open your registered email lets you know that your r&eacute;sum&eacute; made it past spam filters, and that you may soon follow up with a phone call to its recipient. This saves you time and needless worrying, and increases your chance of getting hired.
<br />
<br />
However, when emailing is <u>not</u> a requirement, and when you highly value getting a particular employer's attention, printing your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter and (ideally) hand-delivering them to the employer is the best approach. This way no spam filter or delete button, or human resources department,  office manager or other &quot;gate keeper&quot; is likely to prevent them from arriving on the desk of the person who based on your employer research is most likely to hire you or recommend hiring you.
<br />
<br />
To maximize the effectiveness of this approach, you need to  provide this key, named company contact with a quality, personalized cover letter capable of getting their attention and motivating them to read your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, in turn, will be customized for this employer and contact, and  clearly demonstrate how you can make them money or save them money and solve some of their problems. Do this well and expect to be interviewed, assuming the company believes that they have or can create a position for you.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The JobPro Directory</strong> enables you to  send registered, easily modified template-based, personalized registered email cover letters and your r&eacute;sum&eacute; at the click of a button. These  cover letter templates also open in Microsoft Word in one mouse click for when you will be hand-delivering your r&eacute;sum&eacute; or employment proposal to targeted employers.
